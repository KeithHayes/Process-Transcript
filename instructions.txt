This code may have introduced the problem.  I want the chunk deformatted after it is moved from what had been the upper part of 
a formatted chunk to the lower part of an unformatted chunk.  For development it did not matter but now it does as the 
entire purpose of this project is to smoothly construct sentences across chunk boundaries.
