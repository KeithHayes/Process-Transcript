The LLM is not processing data. the test.py file is old and it needs to be updated to reflect the changes now in formatchunk in 
class ParseFile.

At this time do not attempt to fix process.py.  The LLM will be debugged using test.py.  Maake the changes needed to test.py.

Only after the test.py can identify the sentences in the first 250 words in transcript_preprocessed.txt and delineate them with newlines 
instead of spaces will formatchunk in class ParseFile be changed.


test.py will check the error condition that the number of returned words does not match.  This can be done simply by comparing 
total length which does not change since only spaces are replaced with newlines in certain places which mark sentences.
