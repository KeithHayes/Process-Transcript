While formatted_transcript is generated the content is corrected to be in coherent sentences that use periods, 
commas, and capital letters as requirementts dictate.

The purpose of the LLM is to translate a raw audio transcript into an essay format that has paragraphs and gramatically correct 
sentences. Headings where appropriate.  Paragraphs and headings are separated by a blank line.  Do not use connecting dashes.  
Connecting dashes can be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and the capital letter of 
a new sentence as appropriate if grammar cannot make the transition with an appropriate connecting word.

Current output is not formattted.  This does not meet requirements.  I seen no capital letters or punctation 
marks or paragraphs.  They should all be there.  A file showing sample output is 'desired_output.txt'

The document is split into multiple chunks with overlap making smooth transitions in the output. Each time a chunk is 
processed a command line entry should show a new call has been made to the llm witth the chunk.  The sample transcript is several chunks 
long but current output does not show that it is.

Dignose the problem.
