The LLM is not processing data. the test.py file is needs to be corrected.

At this time the only file changed is test.py.  The LLM will be debugged using test.py.

Only after the test.py can identify the sentences in the first 250 words in transcript_preprocessed.txt and delineate them with newlines 
instead of the spaces used now will formatchunk in class ParseFile be changed to reflect lessons not yet learned.


test.py will check the error condition that the number of returned words does not match those sent.  This can be done simply by comparing 
the total length of the total length which does not change since only spaces are replaced with newlines in certain places which 
mark sentences in the algorithm.

verify the model.  the loaded model does not have to match but there must be a model loaded.  Here is some sample code.

import requests

url = "http://0.0.0.0:5000/v1/completions"
payload = {
    "model": "TheBloke_Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-AWQ",
    "prompt": "[INST] What is the capital of France? [/INST]",
    "max_tokens": 20
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response:", response.json())
