1. Preserve ALL original words exactly as they appear
2. Maintain the EXACT original word order
3. DO NOT add any new words or content
4. Only add punctuation where sentences clearly end
5. Replace the space BEFORE each sentence with a newline
6. Replace the space AFTER each sentence with a newline
7. Keep the space after the last word if present
8. DO NOT modify any words - only add punctuation and newlines

This is a two step process and the processes are being debugged together because they are interdependent.


The test.py file is needs to be rewritten.  Only file to be changed is test.py.  The LLM will be debugged using test.py only.  Only after the test.py can 
identify the sentences in the first 250 words in transcript_preprocessed.txt and delineate them with newlines 
instead of the spaces used now will formatchunk in class ParseFile be changed to reflect lessons not yet learned.

First the LLM will identify existing sentences in the test text which is the first chunk of 250 words 
which ends with a space.  The test code will read the input from preprocessed.

The LLM will puncuate these sentences.  Only identified sentences will be punctuated.

Preserve all original words exactly
Maintain original word order
Do not add any new content
A newline replaces the space in front of a sentence that was originally a word separator.
A newline replaces the space at the end of a sentence that was originally a word separator.

This is the end of step one.  Sentences are identified, and where they are identified as complete they are 
punctuated with newline characters replacing the spaces before and after the sentence unless the space is 
after the last word in which case the space remains.

This puts each identified sentence on a separate line.

End of the first step.

Next step:

In a post processing step regular expressions will remove all sentence formatting retaining only newlines.

if everything is correct the end string length will match the input length.  all that has happened is that the sentences
identified by the llm are on separate lines.

Currently ',' and ';' arttifactts remain as artifacts from LLM formatting and must be removed in the regular expression task.
