Until input is right the output is not valid.

Savechunks() has been removed and the functionality is inlined.  Merging chunks is complicated. Currently the valid output to save for comparison 
on each format event to verify the outpput file is being worked out.

The output to check on each cycle will be determined when the five training LoRA events are worked out.

..............


DOCUMENTSIZE = 884
CHUNKSIZE = 125
OVERLAP = 75
inputpointer = 0
contextwindow = ""
outputstring = ""



load contextwindow with CHUNKSIZE + OVERLAP from  inputpointer
inputpointer += CHUNKSIZE + OVERLAP //  200
format()

split the context window and save the lower half in the outputstring keep the upper half and add a new chunk to it.
inputpointer += CHUNKSIZE // 325
format()
check to see if inputpointer > DOCUMENTSIZE go to Exit if if is

split the context window and save the lower half in the outputstring keep the upper half and add a new chunk to it.
inputpointer += CHUNKSIZE // 450
format()
check to see if inputpointer > DOCUMENTSIZE go to Exit if if is

split the context window and save the lower half in the outputstring keep the upper half and add a new chunk to it.
inputpointer += CHUNKSIZE // 575 700 825 *884
format()
check to see if inputpointer > DOCUMENTSIZE go to Exit if if is







Exit: save the context window in the outputstring
