in process.py I have this to complete.  


                        # is this needed
                        # if chunk is not empty then it should be processed
                        # formatted_chunk = await self.formatchunk(self.chunk)                                        # Format
                        # sentence_ends_marked = re.sub(r'(?<=[.?!])\s+', SENTENCE_MARKER, formatted_chunk)           # Mark sentence ends
                        # sentence_starts_marked = re.sub(r'\s+(?=[A-Z])', SENTENCE_MARKER, sentence_ends_marked)     # Mark sentence starts
                        # self.chunk = self.deformat(sentence_starts_marked)
                        # self.savechunk()


But before it is completed it must be verified that the code would ever 
be used.  It depends on how many words are in the input array and how the chunks are processed.  I think I need it, but am not sure.
