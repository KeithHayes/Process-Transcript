Debug and verify, 

Produce the desired output file.  

It appears the last chunk is not merging into transcript_processed.txt correctly.


Key improvements to make:


    Modify savechunk to:

        Handle the final chunk differently by writing all remaining words

        Only maintain overlap if there's more input to process

        Clear the chunk buffer when processing is complete

        Added more detailed logging

    Update the main process loop to:

        Better handle the transition to the final chunk

        Ensure all content is properly written

        Added more explicit state management

    The changes will ensure that:

        The final chunk's words are all written to output

        No words are lost at the end of processing

        The overlap mechanism works correctly throughout

        Better logging for debugging chunk processing

These changes should resolve the issue where the last chunk wasn't being properly merged into the output file, 
particularly the fragmented words at the end of the processed transcript.

The algorithm now:

    Processes each chunk completely before moving to the next

    Handles the final chunk as a special case where all remaining words are written

    Maintains proper overlap between chunks during processing

    Cleans up properly at the end of processing
