Current status:   

Preliminary results show promise.

Formatted_transcript.txt has content to be verified.



Design :


While formatted_transcript is generated the content is corrected to be in coherent sentences that use periods, 
commas, and capital letters as requirementts dictate.

The purpose of the LLM is to translate a raw audio transcript into an essay format that has paragraphs and gramatically correct 
sentences. Headings where appropriate.  Paragraphs and headings are separated by a blank line.  Do not use connecting dashes.  
Connecting dashes can be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and the capital letter of 
a new sentence as appropriate if grammar cannot make the transition with an appropriate connecting word.

Current output is not formattted.  This does not meet requirements.  I seen no capital letters or punctation 
marks or paragraphs.  They should all be there.  A file showing sample output is 'desired_output.txt'

The document is split into multiple chunks with overlap making smooth transitions in the output. Each time a chunk is 
processed a command line entry should show a new call has been made to the llm witth the chunk.  The sample transcript is several chunks 
long but current output does not show that it is.

Chunking will have to be along word boundaries because of the nature of the continuous transcript.   

Transistions are smooth because the chumking connects already formatted sections as it merges output 
along word boundaries.

Overlap at the beginning of fresh ubformatted lines from the previously formatted chunk allows the end of formatted 
output to be rewritten as a new chunk is merged.  This makes proper formatting at chunk transitions.

It also removes bad formatting near the end of a previous chunk.


Example:  If a chunk is 1000 characters long the second chunnk would begin at 800 characters so the 
first 200 characters are formatformatted with previous content providing formatting input.  This overlap allows the 
overlap to be correctly rewritten so a smooth transition replaces the abrupt end.

The end of the second chunk is at 1800 so the third chunk begins at 1600 to repeat the overlap 
re-write process until a smooth translation of the entire file has been accomplished.

As new chunks are added the overlap of thee previous chunk is removed.

This should be a common technique to process a translation in chunks and the web should be 
consulted as needed to ensure logic is correct.

The overlap is intended to fix problems with chunking in the middle of a sentence or paragraph.

Because the overlap is removed and replaced by the start of a new chunk, paragraphs and sentences and such 
can be properly formatted.
