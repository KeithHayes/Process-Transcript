sys:1: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'ParseFile.formatchunk' was never awaited


formatchunk had been an empty stub and it is being developed to mark sentences in a text string by delimiting them with 
newlines instead of the spaces which currently surround them.  The llm is loaded and waiting for input.  correct whatever 
is wrong with self.chunk = self.formatchunk(self.chunk)
