The only file to be modified is process.py

I use an array of characters and process it to find words, but the code I have in 
savechunk(self): converts the array into a string and then processes the string.

This technique is superior to what I have in the other class definitions in process.py

Change the code to match the technique.

class ParseFile:
    input_pointer = 0
    output_pointer = 0
    input_array = []
    chunk = []
    output_array = []


input_array, chunk, output_array will be strings

make no otther improvements than to refine the string processing to replace array processing in the 
ParseFile class.
