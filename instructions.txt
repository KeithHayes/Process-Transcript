Current status:   

Output is generated, but the program algorithm has not been clearly defined until now.  Therefore the project must be examined and 
compared to the following logic and corrected as needed.

Purpose.  To identify sentences and punctuate and correct them when they are found.  Leaving other text unchanged.


Algorithm design :

Considering the previous chunk if any as possibly providing the start of a sentence in the new chunk, identify all complete sentences in the chunk. 
If a complete sentence is identified the spelling and punctuation is corrected for that sentence.  Sentences start with a capital letter and end 
with a period or question mark.  Sentences have commas, connecting dashes will not be used.  Text that is not is in a sentence will be unchanged. 
Linefeeds are removed and a space is optionally added to enforce word boundries.

When a new chunk is added it overlaps the previous chunk, allowing the overlapped part to be rewritten subject to new chunk information 
such as the new chunk completeing tthe sentence.

The purpose of the LLM is to identify sentences in a raw audio transcript and gramatically correct them.

Connecting dashes must be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and 
the capital letter of a new sentence as appropriate.

The document is split into multiple chunks with overlap to accomplish the sentence detections across chunk boundaries.

Chunking is along word boundaries.   

Chumking overlap allows corrections on the tail end of formatted output to accomidate information as the new chunk overlap 
replaces the end of the previous chunk as the new chunk is appended to the output.

Example:  If a chunk is 1000 characters long the second chunnk would begin at 800 characters so the 
first 200 characters are copied and possibly reformatted the previous chunk.  

This overlap allows a sentence to be found across a chunk boundry.

The end of the second chunk is at 1800 so the third chunk begins at 1600 to repeat the overlap re-write correction process allowing 
all complete sentences to be identified and gramatically corrected.

This should be a common technique to process a 'translation' in chunks.  The web should be consulted as needed to ensure logic is correct.

Text outside of sentences is unchanged except that line breaks are removed.

A single blank line will divide chunks as they are added to the output file.  These blank lines are invisible to the algorithm and formatting 
process as they are added post processing only to the output file.

The task.  

Complete evaluation of the existing code must be done to see what part of the desired algortithm has been implemented and to 
determine what must be corrected.

Complete files will be returned so python maintains correct indentation should there be any changes in python files.

Current output in 'formatted_transcript.txt' does not match 'desired_output.txt'.  Correction is required.
