Consider changes so output better matches input.

Desired output is cleaned into a word file containing 
words, words with special characters, and spaces as the only whitespace.

This becomes test input since it can be compared to output.

The LLM must not change the words or word order as it finds sentences in the input string of words.  This is priority.

A first pass identifies sentences and another pass punctuates them.  This seems like it could be simplified but it must not be.

The two pass structure must be maintained because it lets regular expressions properly connect sentences in the output as 
a side effect of removing the last punctuation mark in the new format and then allowing it be added in with the next chunk 
loaded and formated.

framents of sentences should be collected on a line if they follow each other or they should be on the line by itself
