The test.py reads the first 250 words from preprocessed.txt

The 250 words are formatted into sentences where complete sentences can be identified in the text.
Text that is not part of a complete sentence is unchanged

The formatted sentences are then used to identify where sentence breaks are.  These are filled with \n

Sentence breaks identified the sentences are deformatted

words, word order, and number of words do not change, temporary formatting is added but then removed after 
sentence breaks are marked.

The total length in characters of the final result will have increased the character count of the input by 
the number of line breaks because \n is two bytes.

Current code changed a couple of words and completed the partial sentence at the end of the input which 
should not have been done as text outside of a complete sentence is not changed and witin a sentence words also do
not change.
