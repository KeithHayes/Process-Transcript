While formatted_transcript is generated the content has not been corrected to be in coherent sentences that use periods, 
commas, and capital letters.

The purpose of the LLM is to translate a raw audio transcript into an essay format that has paragraphs and gramatically correct 
sentences. Headings where appropriate.  Paragraphs and headings are seperated by a blank lines.  Do not use connecting dashes.  
Connecting dashescan be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and the capital letter of 
a new sentence as appropriate where grammar cannot make the transition with the correct connecting word.

Current output is not much different from the input.  That does not meet requirements.
