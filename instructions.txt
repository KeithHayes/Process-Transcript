The end as it should be:

alice closed the anthology pressed a finger against the spine and slid the book into its place on the shelf
she sat for a moment longer teacup in hand simply being
it was a practice in mindfulness in appreciating transition
the end of daylight and arrival of evening the movement from narrative to reflection
She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine preparing a light supper writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars
When she finally stood the teacup empty the anthology closed and the quiet settled deeply over the room alice felt a gentle contentment
gratitude even
for the stories yes and for the world beyond them for the tactile living reality she inhabits
and so at the close of day she gave thanks for words for solitude and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment
