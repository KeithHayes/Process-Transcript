While formatted_transcript is generated the content has not been corrected to be in coherent sentences that use periods, 
commas, and capital letters.

The purpose of the LLM is to translate a raw audio transcript into an essay format that has paragraphs and gramatically correct 
sentences. Headings where appropriate.  Paragraphs and headings are seperated by a blank line.  Do not use connecting dashes.  
Connecting dashes can be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and the capital letter of 
a new sentence as appropriate if grammar cannot make the transition with an appropriate connecting word.

Current output is not much different from the input.  This does not meet requirements.  I seen no capital letters or punctation 
marks or paragraphs.  They should all be there.

Also the way this works is the document is split into multiple chunks with overlap making smooth transitions. each time a chunk is 
processed a command line entry should show a new call has been made to the llm.  and I know my document is longer than one chunk 
so the display 1/1 can no way be correct.
