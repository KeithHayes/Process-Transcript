The LLM is not processing data correctly. the test.py file is needs to be corrected.

At this time the only file to be changed is test.py.  The LLM will be debugged using test.py only.  Only after the test.py can 
identify the sentences in the first 250 words in transcript_preprocessed.txt and delineate them with newlines 
instead of the spaces used now will formatchunk in class ParseFile be changed to reflect lessons not yet learned.


There current Lesson learned is that the LLM cannot refrain from puncuating sentences as it identifies them.

Therefore the LLM will be encouraged to identify and punctuate sentences and in the process the newlines will be added 
before the capital letter of a sentence and after the period or question mark or exclamation point terminator.

Then regular expressions will remove all sentence formatting retaining only any added newlines in a post processing step

Enhancing the identification of sentences and then removing the unwanted formatting from them, but retaining the newlines using 
regular expressions will be a more robust solution.

if everything is correct the end string length will match the input length.
