Nema: Hi everybody Today is Saturday June 21st 2025 and our friend Pepe Escobar is back with us Welcome back Pepe

Pepe: Nema Always a pleasure I turned uh Russia upside down to be here with you tonight It's 11 in Moscow I just arrived from St Petersburg to be here on time, so we could do this relaxed you know at least a little bit.

Nema: Let's let's get started Pepe with what's going on in the Middle East.  he situation as time goes by is getting more dangerous more fragile.  And it seems that the United States is doing everything, is moving these fighter jets bombers close to Iran.  They're preparing for an attack on Iran.  Even CNN reported that this sort of idea of two weeks, and there's somehow there it's a game of deception

Pepe: Of course 

Nema: to keep Teran confused. Your take on what's going on. 

Pepe: Ah can I make an introduction Nema before I answer your question. 

Nema: Go ahead 

Pepe: Because we need to talk about St Petersburg.

Nema: Yeah 

Pepe: Uh it was the most important forum in Russia this year, and I heard from global south businessmen in St. Petersburg. According to global southern businessmen who attended, it was the most significant forum in Russia this year. In attendance were representatives from Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central Asia, as well as Russia, China. To provide some context, on Wednesday there was a Russia-China business panel that was completely packed, with businessmen from both sides, local governors in Russia from various oblasts, and everyone engaged in discussion about business opportunities. The Russian government was also present, expressing their amazement at the level of investment coming from China in various projects. There was a particularly impressive panel featuring our friend Apollo Batista.

Paulo Batista: The real thing is, we need to go for broke and start the necessary reforms now. Our window of opportunity is quite small.

This issue is hardly ever discussed, even in Russia or China. In my previous panel on fake news, we delved deeper into this topic, exploring issues such as control of information, artificial intelligence, and how digital technology is enabling big tech to produce fake news themselves. For example, a high-ranking executive from the largest Russian bank shared some alarming statistics regarding fake news worldwide. Surprisingly, Palantir—a leading AI company—is now embedded within the U. S. federal government. Having such a powerful high-tech firm shaping policies raises concerns.

okay let's say among the top high-tech companies in the west now dictating policy How serious is that These people already do uh AI models for the Israelis to kill Palestinians So you know it's getting worse by the minute And of course uh uh the uh these Russians uh these Russian friends they started um an organization that the merit of this organizations is enormous It's called Global Factchecking Network uh GFCN You can find them online They have their own website Uh lots of uh people have joined including myself and we are trying to maybe um set up a blueprint about uh controlling fake news checking fake news and get this conversation going to the point that it would land on the bricks table Of course it's not going to be in Rio in a few days you know but the next brick summit next year in South Africa and then if you have this discussed by the bricks there's a strong possibility that we can have uh just an example uh the beginning of a bricks net or a bricks tube or a all around.

in South Africa and then if you have this discussed by the bricks there's a strong possibility that we can have uh just an example uh the beginning of a bricks net or a bricks tube or a all around bricks alternative media sphere because we cannot simply be subjected to the big tech platforms because we know exactly where it's going with the former PayPal mafia with this very very dangerous characters Peter T and Alex Karp and the fact that they are now part of the US government it's even even more dangerous so the forum was this forum is changing Nema it's great because used to be too generalistic until next year This year there were lots of panels that were extremely practical and people discussing possible solutions Everything from geoeconomics to the IT sphere and of course the overarching theme the dark cloud over all of us is your question Iran Israel and US and what is US going to do Um the everybody was waiting for the plenary session which was yesterday right with President.

theme the dark cloud over all of us is your question Iran Israel and US and what is US going to do Um the everybody was waiting for the plenary session which was yesterday right with President Putin But first great thing about the plenary session the global south was represented on stage at the plenary session we had China Indonesia Bahrain and South Africa How cool is that This is a a sample of the global south uh with the the guest of honor the president of Indonesia prao Southeast Asia which puts Putin sees as one of the two top areas of development in the near future Southeast Asia and Africa and of course Putin indirectly uh very diplomatically he answered these questions about Iran Uh it's very clear in the Russian position Iran has absolute inaliable rights to have a civilian nuclear program which is what they have at the moment Number one Number two Putin said that he received personal assurances from Trump and from Netanyahu that they are not going to bomb Busher plant.

nuclear program which is what they have at the moment Number one Number two Putin said that he received personal assurances from Trump and from Netanyahu that they are not going to bomb Busher plant because there are over 200 ultra high tech Russian technicians working at Busher So obviously we we can imagine the conversation right putting on the phone say don't touch Busher and the other two like this because they know the consequences if that happens Number three extremely important There's a lot of criticism um partially in Russia from let's say the Russian Atlanticist gang but mostly AC across the global north that Russia is not doing enough to um help Iran Putin said explicitly these people who are pedling this notion they are provocators provocati literal translation from from Russian So this means we can infer that of course they are helping discreetly Iran in this is a a taboo subject here uh Nema we cannot discuss this publicly I asked people close to the government about it.

So this means we can infer that of course they are helping discreetly Iran in this is a a taboo subject here uh Nema we cannot discuss this publicly I asked people close to the government about it no answers So we discussed this with the people from think tanks for instance Uh and the answer that they they they give is very similar to the answer that I received in Yemen when I asked a member of the high political council What are your exactly your relations with Russia and China And basically he said very diplomatically yes we have our own channels So obviously Thran and Moscow they have their own channels and obviously nobody here is going to expose these channels and what is the level of collaboration and help from Russia to Iran Same thing about China uh I discussed this for instance with my friend professor Jeang wei way he was in this uh China Russ audience as then he had he had to go to his own panel and he said of course there is but this is uh uh this is not in the open in.

Professor Jean Wei: With my friend Professor Wei, we were in the China-Russia audience. He had to go to his own panel and mentioned that. . . this isn't openly discussed in China. The Chinese are very discrete, especially regarding matters they consider partners and matters of national security, which you're quite familiar with, Nemasitkina.

you got answers to these questions you know and it was good that this came out in the plenary session especially apart from that ju just to close this introduction the atmosphere was was buzzing everywhere you could you you could feel that there were deals being struck all the time I gave an example in my telegram column I interviewed a high power Chinese CEO dressed Hong Kong style She said she's going to move she's going to live in Hong Kong next year H currently she is in Beijing Her company wants to invest in Donetsk This is something that nobody in the west knows In fact then my my Donbas friends they organized an interview with the number two of Donetsk Uh he great guy and he said "Look it's not only this lady that you just talked to I every day I receive inquiries from Chinese companies They want to come here and see the investment possibilities. " And he said minerals obviously coal for obvious reasons Now uh Donbas's Donbas is cool oblast or republic uh transportation which.

They want to come here and see the investment possibilities. " And he said minerals obviously coal for obvious reasons Now uh Donbas's Donbas is cool oblast or republic uh transportation which includes connectivity corridors overland and maritime via maropo and tourism because they know the possibilities of of tourism including for China because uh it's a beautiful region Um Marupo could become uh quite something a mix of a spe um uh special economic zone uh important port and a tourism hub as well So um if you don't go to a forum like this you are literally uh blinded by the western narrative And of course everybody I I talked to people people from Astrakan for instance which is part of the international north south transportation corp they love talking to foreign uh journalists and analysts because they are of course you know it's impossible for them to talk to the west and they are doing absolutely amazing stuff uh in ter in terms of integration they talk about how the federal.



Analyst: They cannot speak to the west, yet they are making incredible strides in terms of integration within their regions. The federal government is investing heavily in oblasts and promoting public-private partnerships.

of a new growth model with everything that implicates new growth model something completely different to what we have since 1945 When it comes to you mentioned the situation in in the Middle East in the West Asia between Iran and Israel was discussed How as as I mentioned in my first question h what is the latest development in the region How do you find in the west When you look at the mainstream media in the west they're saying Iran was defeated Iran was destroyed and unbelievable what's going on in the mainstream media It's totally they're totally changing their the reality of what's going on there You're because they're a machine of fake news Nema We know that uh in fact in my panel I described Brussels as a fake news machine In fact the whole collective fragmented decaying west is a fake news machine against anything It can be uh Iraq it can be Syria it can be Libya it can be Somalia and now it can be Gaza and especially Iran Not to mention everything concerning Russia Every.

John Doe: The media is a fake news machine against anything - it can be Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and now Gaza, especially Iran. Not to mention everything concerning Russia.

different story It always go back to manifest destiny exceptionalism shiny city on the hill all that crap you know regurgitated ad infinitum and the for instance the way they are incapable of understanding not only how the Iranian system works how do they make decisions what constitutes an existential threat to Iran how Iran h deals with his neighbors with the Arab world and with Eurasia at large and how Iran has been preparing for this war now for decades because they knew not because they are they are crystal ball readers but because they knew it would be inevitable It's a war of the turbo capitalist system against the Islamic revolution This is the key And now the people behind it they think that they have an opening For instance I have a lot of respect for Sai Hersh Uh when I was growing up when I was still in college Sai Hersh was one of my mo role models as an investigative uh journalist But Sai uh there's a problem with Sai because first of all he doesn't know West Asia very.

up when I was still in college Sai Hersh was one of my mo role models as an investigative uh journalist But Sai uh there's a problem with Sai because first of all he doesn't know West Asia very well which is an enormous problem if you are an investigative journalist Well he basically concentrates in in Washington and his gigantic role decks He can pick up the phone and talk to anybody he wants in Washington This is fantastic Nobody has that kind of of access Right But for instance he writes a piece that is absolutely terrifying this week on his Substack basically reproducing what his sources which are deep uh industrial military complex deeper industrial military complex and Zionist silos working around Washington Virginia and Maryland And what what is it about It's about the war that they always wanted since at least 1998 If some of them they want this war since 1979 as you know very well Regime change in Iran Uh elimination of the Iranian civilian nuclear program Elimination of.

they always wanted since at least 1998 If some of them they want this war since 1979 as you know very well Regime change in Iran Uh elimination of the Iranian civilian nuclear program Elimination of Islamic ballistic missiles basically destroying Iran like they did like they destroyed Iraq without thinking obviously for one minute about uh Iranian capabilities geography you name it of course not these people don't first of all they don't understand they never learn anything from geography history and both so when you read Sihar's piece it is terrifying the level of stupidity and ignorance of these people is terrifying but the problem is some some of these people interviewed by Hirs they have access to decision making in Washington and that's what makes it even more dangerous and it's a quite a collection of of sources you know so if these people actually believe in what they are doing so we better get ready for some sort of apocalypse really apocalypse later not apocalypse now and.

Speaker 1: Quite a collection of sources you know. If these people actually believe in what they're doing, we better get ready for some sort of apocalypse, really. Not apocalypse now, but apocalypse later.

they are not illiterate They are not completely dumb but they are fanatic They are extremely misinformed they have uh positions of power in the nomenclature So in a sense I her speech was uh uh it was a public service for him to public something like this I like his style because he's not judgmental Basically he's reproducing what people told him you know but wow it's one of the most terrifying things I have read in my long long long life around the world Really Pepe when it comes to the attack on Iran and the way that Iran has responded so far if the if Israel is winning what does Donald Trump need to interfere in the conflict Why do they need to go and bomb Iran Israel is winning So let them win the war What's going on that Nema They can't win this war You know that I know that Our most of our audience I'm sure knows that In fact they are losing already They lost the strategic initiative They lost the aura of invincibility for them I I would say that this is a psychological coup.

most of our audience I'm sure knows that In fact they are losing already They lost the strategic initiative They lost the aura of invincibility for them I I would say that this is a psychological coup even worse than losing everything Nobody is afraid of the Israelis anymore Everybody knows that they are a killing machine But it's very very convenient to be a killing machine uh killing women children hospitals journalists humanitarian help etc from above with missiles try try to match yourself against a real regional power They are they are having their ass kicked little by little the Iranian way because Iran for the moment hasn't entered a war against Israel They are probing they it's a sort of a little by little escalation to achieve strategic deterrence which in some aspects they they already have There are some serious gaps in their uh anti-aircraft defenses and anti-missile defenses which might maybe they might get help from Russia to plug these holes if they wanted um quoting.

already have There are some serious gaps in their uh anti-aircraft defenses and anti-missile defenses which might maybe they might get help from Russia to plug these holes if they wanted um quoting Putin again Putin said we offered some stuff to Iran Iran said no we don't want it at least for now if they wanted Russia is willing to help them any way they can So even with the fact that they continue to be attacked by Israel several raids a day missiles targeted assassinations you name it But the destruction that they already inflicted in Tel Aviv and beyond is now unimaginable for everyone Nobody could ever imagine that missiles will be destroying neighborhoods in Israel landing near Dona destroying most of the port of Hifa The mayor of Hifa is desperate now is begging for peace because his sport sooner or later is going to disappear just like uh a lot was bankrupt Hifa will disappear It's not it's not in in the equation anymore oil the oil refinery in in Hifa Same thing So Israel now.

sport sooner or later is going to disappear just like uh a lot was bankrupt Hifa will disappear It's not it's not in in the equation anymore oil the oil refinery in in Hifa Same thing So Israel now for has I would say of their three ports they have maybe 30% left in Ashdod which is near Gaza so it's not very well located the other two are well one of them is non-existence and the other one is slowly sinking so there is a different strategy that was re-elaborated it probably in the first 48 hours by the IRGC I say okay now it's different now it's not strategic patience anymore we going to go best by a thousand cuts and it's working it's working because the number one objective is very ambitious is to paralyze the Israeli economy and they are on the way to do that Nemo seriously with only two weeks Less than two weeks No with two weeks One week It was It started on Friday last week Yeah So exactly We We lose track Everything is so fast So a little over one week They already paralyzed We.

weeks Less than two weeks No with two weeks One week It was It started on Friday last week Yeah So exactly We We lose track Everything is so fast So a little over one week They already paralyzed We can say maybe half of the Israeli economy at least And these attacks on Raphael on the Wiseman Institute on unit 8, 200 this is pinpointed This is absolutely these are the key intel military nodes in Israel Both so you know the the Iranian strategy is calculally calculated We can say it is working They are paying a horrendous price No question because Iran continues to be bombed Uh they are they bombed the Iraq um reactor right Yeah Uh targeting assassinations in K near the shrine in K So there are no limits for these gangsters you but um we can say uh with a measure of certainty that H& RGC they see the big picture ahead Of course if the Americans get what Four B2s dropping four bombs exactly at the same time vertically on the spot over four Then it's a completely new ball game as we know.

see the big picture ahead Of course if the Americans get what Four B2s dropping four bombs exactly at the same time vertically on the spot over four Then it's a completely new ball game as we know which by the way which is not that much possible I talk about it because when you hit the f when you first hit the target the explosion whatever is happening in the aftermath of that impact they're not you're not going to be able to to to hit the target again at the same point At the same point Exactly Nema Not to mention uh smoke debris etc You need perfect visibility on top of it for your heads So c can you imagine that there's absolutely no one at the Pentagon to tell the president of the United States how completely absurd this whole idea is Apparently not right And the guy who's in charge that major imbecile gurilla who is an anti-Iranian islamophobe whatever No wonder he's the guy in charge of the whole operation and he's the guy convincing he's the guy convincing Trump and the whole.

Speaker A:
That major imbecile guru, who is an anti-Iranian Islamophobe, is in charge of the whole operation. He's the oneconvincingTrumpandthewholeteamtofollowthisabsurdnotion. No wonder.

and shades telling us that uh he's he's now afraid because he is totally trapped in his own rhetorical game and in the Zio Con's long running game that comes since the end of the 1990s He's he's in an untenable position and we can already say that he lost the midterms His base half of his base is gone already So bye-bye He's going to be a lame duck after the midterms Not to mention they they might advance to try to impeach him again So it's wow The accumulation of horrors and absurdities is never ending right And when you of course all of us who for professional reasons we have to at least uh get a glimpse of what mainstream media is saying they live in what kind of re now obviously these people don't live in reality but what kind of nether world they live and ping the notion that I know it's the president of the United States is Like God he can decide one day to do the or zeals He he can decide one day to throw a lightning bolt and the other day okay let's have a banquet He decides.

it's the president of the United States is Like God he can decide one day to do the or zeals He he can decide one day to throw a lightning bolt and the other day okay let's have a banquet He decides the future of the world No he doesn't decide anything There are people deciding for him He's basically a lowly messenger a cheap messenger a casino hustler you know a mobster a subm mobster So it's uh it was good to have a few um uh inside um info and commentary from from people in St Petersburg Well well positioned people in the Russian government especially they have no they have no illusions of course and once again they all come back to the same point We have a war here in our borders First we need to solve this and now they're fully concentrated uh what's going to happen in the next few months Uh the conditions are going to be much much tougher if uh not uh Kiev but Kiev's sponsors don't accept what's on the table put on the table by the Russians and meanwhile they keep organizing.

months Uh the conditions are going to be much much tougher if uh not uh Kiev but Kiev's sponsors don't accept what's on the table put on the table by the Russians and meanwhile they keep organizing forums like this so the whole of the global south can get together and strike business deals So there there's always the other side of the coin IMA right The auspicious side of the the coin even in the middle of such darkness What was so important about the the point that Putin raised in St Petersburg said he said that Russia and Iran are fighting the same forces The same this was brilliant Wow Everybody knows what he means He doesn't need to get into detail and Putin doesn't he never needs to spell out okay he needs to spell out especially for Kab But when he's talking to a broad audience which in this case was a global audience everybody was waiting okay what is he going to say about Iran This is possibly the key quote because you can inter interpret this at several levels and at the same.

in this case was a global audience everybody was waiting okay what is he going to say about Iran This is possibly the key quote because you can inter interpret this at several levels and at the same time he said something very crucial which explains a lot of his um let's say circumspection when he deals with Israel He says look we have almost 1. 5 million former USSR and Russian citizens double passports living in Israel speaking Russian So Israel in many aspects is also a Russian land He has to take this into consideration of course So it's it's a his compared to Trump his position is uh of course it's solid but the nuances are extremely complex but because he's he has a legal mind He is a strategist and he weighs everything before making a big big big decision At least we have a rational mind calculating all the vectors right But at the same time he's not going to abandon his principles which is Iran is a very strong ally of the Russian Federation They have mutual interest They have.



Mind: Calculating all the vectors right. . . But at the same time, he won't abandon his principles. Iran is a powerful ally of the Russian Federation. They share mutual interests and business deals. Russia supports Iran's civil nuclear program and remains committed to this alliance.

I don't see anything in that sense is happening in Iran The main goal of these attacks assassination decapitation as they call it was to somehow bring so-called regime change in Iran That doesn't that didn't work so far Shano ima all of us who remember shock in 2003 uh in in Iraq it worked but Iraq was already dissolved as a nation Um I I went to in 2002 I spent one months in Iraq during Saddam It was around September September October So a few months before shock and all And I saw by myself how the country was impoverished after how many 20 years almost 20 years of sanctions destroyed Uh the only thing that more or less worked was the mukabarat the intel services and it would be very easy if the Americans launched and it was uh and even like that it took three three weeks for the whole thing to collapse and it only collapsed because they distributed a lot of money to Saddam's generals Iran now Iran is solid even of course there is oppos you know of course there is opposition uh to.

thing to collapse and it only collapsed because they distributed a lot of money to Saddam's generals Iran now Iran is solid even of course there is oppos you know of course there is opposition uh to the government especially in north Iran the upper middle class the people who dream of Iran under the sha etc but it's a minority in Iran uh so and the fact that now the nation was attacked directly it unified the nation completely as you know very well Nema but try to explain this in Washington Nobody will understand First of all these idiots never been to Iran They don't know how it works They don't know anything The culture history how the system works You name it Uh different levels of popularity If you compare uh Kistan with Mashad with the Caspian with the Persian Gulf and they don't even they don't know anything They only have the obsession we need to get rid of Kam We have to kill him and then we're going to have the son of the sha to be our guy This the level of stupidity is.



Pepe: They don't know anything. All they have is an obsession. We need to get rid of Kam.

or among them etc You and medv can Yes This is very very very serious Absolutely Absolutely And and once again it looks like nobody in Washington in a position of power or in a position to control foreign policy is listening to their detriment If they get into this adventure which as it stands there is a strong possibility We no none of us know but all the signs are that something will happen and something nefarious will happen and something like a mother of all mistakes might occur So they're going to pay a heavy heavy price for it The the problem is in the west when they want to go to war they're so much somehow melted in their own rhetoric that they cannot hear anything from outside They feel that they're going to they're going to achieve what they want to achieve by this sort of war against other nations But after all we know that it doesn't work the way that they were talking about this Iran is not other countries like Iraq Afghanistan I'm sure today I talk with Professor Mirandi.

other nations But after all we know that it doesn't work the way that they were talking about this Iran is not other countries like Iraq Afghanistan I'm sure today I talk with Professor Mirandi Okay Prepared to fight the United States Absolutely We are totally prepared to fight it and come in and do it We We are prepared to respond to you I It's not just about Iran Yemen just announced that there if the United States dares to attack Iran they're going to attack the United States in the Red Sea bubble mand somehow and and on the other hand I heard something from China the I don't know you the the political analyst Victor G from China here is what he said go is very good he's very here is what he said in terms of if the United States attacks Iran back against aggressors and if the United States wants to join Israel to become an aggressor against Iran well history will eventually have its own verdict If other countries want to join the fight on the side of Israel I will urge them to stop.

wants to join Israel to become an aggressor against Iran well history will eventually have its own verdict If other countries want to join the fight on the side of Israel I will urge them to stop that right away And if for example other countries want to join the fight against Iran you never want to exclude the possibility that other major countries want to fight together with Iran because the war imposed on Iran is the unjustified war It's a war of aggression It's undeclared war It's a surprise attack and any people any country any country under such surprise attack an attack of aggression has full legal justification to fight back Yeah What Victor is saying uh it's very important Nema because this is essentially the position of the leadership in Beijing It's exactly the same position which they express of course very politely uh in the briefings of the minister of foreign affairs in Beijing and all that but this is their position and it's implied that if that happens they will help.

they express of course very politely uh in the briefings of the minister of foreign affairs in Beijing and all that but this is their position and it's implied that if that happens they will help Iran in ways that none of us can imagine what would be the Chinese way of course discreet made in the shape hate They don't talk about it We We've seen that in Ukraine We know how they act and they they don't talk about it Even with with the case of Russia Iran when Iran was somehow sending drones to Russia nobody was talking about it You remember that These countries are helping each other without talking about it Unlike what the United States and Europeans do Uh yes because they are masters of uh narrative twisting and blah blah blah And Russia Iran and China they have interlocked strategic partnerships It's on a completely different level There's no comparison Civilization states who have interlocking strategic partnerships and have the same interest and they are all on board on the main.



Partnerships:.

Partnerships: They say do they really belong here you see and it's completely stupid because they depend on Russia they depend on Iran They are partners in the international north south transportation corridor which is a lifeline commercial lifeline for them But the relationship between New Delhi and Tel Aviv is wow this is quite something And of course don't forget the affinity the ideological affinities between Zionism and Hindutva uh supremacism That's not good at all You know Axis Pepe Axis reported that the United States tried to set up a meeting with Iran in Estanul but it didn't work Supreme leader Yeah refused to talk with the United States But we know that the Iranian foreign minister went to Europe He talked with foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom together with Germany and France The outcome of that those talks they were they were just repeating the same sort of demands on the part of the United States No enrichment even they want to bring in the missile the.

Germany and France The outcome of that those talks they were they were just repeating the same sort of demands on the part of the United States No enrichment even they want to bring in the missile the the missile program of Iran Unbelievable I don't know if it seems as time goes by Iran sees no solution but fight in the United States Yes Uhhuh The Shihuawas uh you saw the Shihu were demanding zero enrichment Who the hell are the Shihu to demand anything from a sovereign nation Especially because these imbeciles were part of the original JCPOA Germany was an observer in JCPOA It was the P uh was P3 plus one that was called Yeah Uh yeah I think P3+ one Germany was part of uh Vienna I can't believe that Well okay let's say that they had slightly less imbecile leaderships at the time Okay which is true technically In fact it was B5 plus one if I'm not I'm sorry Nema Yes P5+1 the five of the UNC plus German And now they Okay zero enrichment Okay in fact zero zero everything Get rid of.



Nema: Yes, P5+1 refers to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Now, according to reports, they have agreed to zero enrichment for Iran.

that Since then they have received 14 weapon shipments from the United States and Germany to just sustain sustain certainly interceptors we are we we don't know what's inside of but okay if we want to bet interceptors because they are actually running from out of interceptor we can we can see that they are not only they are intercepting much less but they are very very careful with how many intercept chapters they're going to launch because they know that it's dwindling and it's part of the Iranian strategy once again And did the Iranians lose anything important so far On the contrary they got rid of all their older missiles And what were the older missiles doing Depleting the interceptor uh fleet Let's put it this way Brilliant Straight to the point Very simple Obviously nobody saw about it the Israelis and the Americans and both proves once again that it works Simple strategies do work So wait until Iran starts to sending uh fles of their latest editions you know the Hajikasam Fatu.

it the Israelis and the Americans and both proves once again that it works Simple strategies do work So wait until Iran starts to sending uh fles of their latest editions you know the Hajikasam Fatu you name it Wow But they are guarding this for the second stage which certainly is the calculations that they have that the United States sooner or later would enter the war Just like Russia in many aspects it's still saving the best that they have for the possibility later on of NATO and the United States having ideas about Russia So there are similarities and this is something that they can discuss at the highest level strategic level ministry of defense level and all that Look we're fighting more or less the same war Yes it is the same war It's the same forever war in two different theaters uh with the same backers on the other side and with the same objectives And the objective number one is to plunder the natural wealths of both Russia and Iran and to prevent by all means necessary.

uh with the same backers on the other side and with the same objectives And the objective number one is to plunder the natural wealths of both Russia and Iran and to prevent by all means necessary Eurasia integration with both of them with China especially and everybody in between and around them It's as simple as that and is as complex as that So nothing is um by accident in this progression If we look at the progression since uh Maidan to Ukraine uh to the SMO to the okay how the SMO is going to be resolved to the negotiations on the Russian front negotiations on the Iranian front the state that we are now we are on the brink of the US entering another forever war everything makes sense it's a progression absolutely our friend Sergey Glazia have uh he he gave the short version of we are discussing now and he said and level three was u Ukraine so it didn't work so they are on level four level four is go against Iran and level five will be against China we are on level we are entering.

discussing now and he said and level three was u Ukraine so it didn't work so they are on level four level four is go against Iran and level five will be against China we are on level we are entering level four now absolutely and they are desperate because there's nothing they can do in terms of level three they're going to start a nuclear war against Russia they will lose Do they have what it takes to attack Russia No they don't in every aspect Are they going to accept that they are have been strategically defeated by Russia No they won't Will that change anything No it won't So okay you change the subject which is exactly where we are now They changed the subject Okay regime change in Iran Let's see if it works No it won't work So they'll be even more desperate after that What are what they're going to do False flag in Taiwan So you know when you put this all when you follow the process you put this all together you see the level of desperation Nema of these people because usually.

they're going to do False flag in Taiwan So you know when you put this all when you follow the process you put this all together you see the level of desperation Nema of these people because usually when we have a situation like this in the world okay the solution is a war to reset the system is what happened from 39 to 45 Now if you launch a war you will reset the system but against you And that's what makes them even more abysmally desperate There's no other way that the war will work in their favor Ukraine proved that and something that is unimaginable for several generations Israel sold the miss to everybody that they were invincible Bye-bye Not anymore Your miss is shattered And they won't be able to live with that And uh in the mid to long term they will vote with their feet They will go back to Eastern Europe where they came from because none of these people are Semites But this is a long process It's starting now So it's fascinating how the angel of history to get one of my.

will go back to Eastern Europe where they came from because none of these people are Semites But this is a long process It's starting now So it's fascinating how the angel of history to get one of my favorite images of all time by Walter Benjamin uh the angel of history is looking back you know over his shoulder to the past but he cannot move into the future because he's encumbered by all the horrors of the past in front of him but sometimes you know let's say he looks into the he turns his head again he starts looking at the future again I said oh there is a glimmer of light over there so even if I am in shackles here I can maybe you know have one that uh we may be at this point now a a angel of history correction of all the horrors unleashed by that construct in West Asia So that of of course and this involves unimaginable suffering and horrors but you know always you have to pay history is not free for anybody You have to pay and even the winners or even the pe the the people's.



Buting:
History comes at an unimaginable cost. Even those who emerge victorious must pay. Culture, civilizations - even those that rise from ruin – face a heavy toll. In the case of Russia, its rebirth came during the 2000s after enduring the turmoil of the '90s, which some call Russia’s “Valley of Tears. ” However, despite these challenges, Russia has reclaimed its place among the global powers.

convoluted way forgive me all of you that maybe this could be the beginning for a resurrection of Palestine later on because if Zion if Zionism machine is shattered they will naturally dissolve and that thing will dissolve and they will go back to Poland Ukraine even Russia Yeah Eastern Europe in general Well and that's it And the land will return to their rightful owners Here is Pepe Here is what Donald Trump said Yes Foreign Minister this afternoon said if the US is serious about negotiations that you would call up Israel and request that they stop their air strikes Will you make that request Well I think it's very hard to make that request right now If somebody's winning it's a little bit harder to do than if somebody's losing But we're ready willing and able And we've been speaking to Iran and we'll see what happens Yeah He feels that he's winning Pepe I Nema they are not they're not giving him the right information Simple as that It's obvious It's he doesn't know anything that's.

John Doe: Iran and we'll see what happens.
Mary Smith: Yes, he feels that he's winning. Pepe I Nema is not providing accurate information. It's obvious.
JD: It's he doesn't know anything that's going on over there. Obviously, and he doesn't read.
MS: Once again, we have discussed this many times. A president who doesn't read and relies on television, talking points, and sound bites is clearly a hostage.
JD: It was a long time ago when he said "We're going to go and destroy Houthis, destroy Yemenis. " And yet, we capitulated.

not going to be able to defeat Iran on of course not Yeah But there's nobody uh capable of telling him that uh around him in his circle of power and much less uh in the industrial military complex Uh of course our friends independent analysts with uh their experience inside the deep state They could explain this for him in five minutes Ray McGovern could meet uh Trump and tell him five minutes look the whole thing is absurd But would he listen Of course not Even if that happened The United States has brought the their fighter jet to Saudi Arabia Do you believe if they wanted to attack Iran they would use Saudi Arabia Because I would say that that would be the end of Saudi Arabia That would be the end of Saudi family Well NBS is losing sleep on all that Obviously he knows NBS is not a fool He may be a gangster but he's not a fool Um yeah we we we don't know how the let's say the background infrastructure to help an American attack on Iran what they would use anything that they use will.



John: He may be a gangster but he's not a fool. We don't know how the United States would construct the infrastructure for an attack on Iran or what methods they might use. The fact that he's a gangster doesn't mean everything he uses would be a legitimate target for Iran. This has been explicitly stated by those in power in Tehran repeatedly. The Gulf Cooperation Council understands this, and there are ongoing diplomatic dialogues between Iran and various countries. Everyone knows this. They're afraid because it won't be a Tehran decision; it will be a Washington decision. It's the empire that decides which vessels will be used for the operation, and those caught up.



Ryane:
They're afraid because it won't be a Tehran decision; it will be a Washington decision. The empire decides which vessels will be used for the operation, and those caught up are saying goodbye. In the case of Iran, I recall when the war in Ukraine started. How cautious Russia was – even now, given the ongoing war in Ukraine. I see the same attitude in Iran. Iranians aren't going all out against Israel because they know they're waiting for something bigger than Israel. They wanted the United States to come and then demonstrate what they could do, not only with Israel but also with the Arab states.

nuclear facilities and all of that I we know these sort of rhetorics They're they they want to make the case for the administration to go after the plan to attack Iran They don't care about the outcome They don't care about what's going on in the aftermath of that attack But that would be the end of Donald Trump and his administration in my opinion because look at what's going on in the United States with MAGA Look at what's going on with Tucker Carlson It's not just about Taco Carson Matt Gates Somehow they tried to convince or somehow put pressure on Tulsi Gabbard She backed down in her recent tweet on X But after all you cannot change the base You cannot change the mindset of those people who voted for you who wanted some sort of change These are big things that are happening in the in my opinion in the mind of Donald Trump himself before going to Iran It's not just about Iran It's about the future of the United States Absolutely Um well once again he's caught in a net in a very.

Donald Trump: In my opinion, before going to Iran, it's not just about Iran; it's about the future of the United States.
Interlocutor: Absolutely. Well, once again, he seems to be caught in a complicated trap set up by the Zionist axis.
Trump: He's another expendable U. S. president. If my presidency implodes due to an out-of-control stupid adventure in Iran, the Zionist axis will continue, and they will find another one to implement their plans.
Interlocutor: That's what's so terrifying. It's yet another conclusion from the SIH column. You read the column.

the levels of power in the US government and you know this is not going to happen and if it was going to take maybe it could take decades or generations just like u those mega fanatic settlers in the West Bank There's no other way to get rid of them except I don't I don't need to spell out right otherwise they'll keep you know the virus will continue indefinitely So we are all hostages of this um I use it in the title of one of my columns a death cult and the death cult is not only Israel the death cult is impregnated in the tissue of the US government We all know Eisenhower alerted everybody about it We all know that JFK was fighting against it and we all know what happened afterwards No Pepe Europeans United Kingdom and Germany are helping the Israel and even even United Kingdom is preparing the fighter jets to go to the region to help the United States You look at this situation You've mentioned that before but they're literally the same people They're that fight in the Iran.

Speaker 1: The Philippines is preparing the fighter jets to go to the region to help the United States.

Iran What is what it has to do with Germany and the United Kingdom Unless you think that the Israeli project is the is a British project they need to go Uh Germany and France are inconsequential So whatever they do nobody cares because they are inconsequential The Brits is different It's MI6 So it's regime change For the Brits is regime change It's the same Uh the way MI6 and the British ruling classes look at Iran is exactly the way the Zionist look at Iran Regime change We did a puppet over there and we need to make a lot of money out of re Iran's national natural resources and of course block exactly u this association between Russia Iran and China this is what really matters ana in the European theater France and Germany they don't even qualify as a consequences nobody can their army they cannot fight a a war in a basta inconsequential the outcome Pepe if the United States finally decides to attack Iran I would say they're not going to be able to do regime change so-called regime.

they cannot fight a a war in a basta inconsequential the outcome Pepe if the United States finally decides to attack Iran I would say they're not going to be able to do regime change so-called regime change they're not going to be able to defeat Iran but the outcome would be devastating for the future and the way that don't that the United States wants to have some sort of leverage or some sort of strate strategic partnership in the Middle East That's going to be gone These Arab state would be destroyed I would say it before it happening I would confess that they're going to do this They're going to do this Is insanity This is unbelievable what Donald Trump is playing with This is We know how capable Iran is You can you can hit Iran so hard but they're going to fight back They're going to destroy whatever you have in that region in in the Middle East I don't know if there is anybody in the Trump administration or so that would be my question to you uh Nema Uh your conversations with.



Narrator: Your conversations with Iranians this past few days - do you know if there's anyone in the Trump administration who wants to destroy whatever exists in that region in the Middle East?

He actually said that He said this Wow Wow These people are totally in bed with what's going on in they want to literally they want to divide Iran in oblast and they want to Kurds Turks Arabs Beluchis and all of this This is the main goal the endgame on their part in my opinion and and Iran knows this These are huge These these are smart people These are not some ordinary people talking about because they they want to hear the argument on the part of the west They know what they're doing and they were preparing for this They knew that this would come to them This reminds me uh Nema one of the things that struck me last It's incredible I was in Iran last months when I went to Sistan Baluchistan Finally the people that I talk Sistan is more to the N more to the north sorry of of the huge province as you know and the Baluchi we were interacting with Baluches all the time They saw they see themselves first and foremost as Iranians No they're not separatists at all Even though the province.

as you know and the Baluchi we were interacting with Baluches all the time They saw they see themselves first and foremost as Iranians No they're not separatists at all Even though the province is enormous has a very peculiar history is very far away from the center No but they see themselves as Iranians and the development of Chabahar port it's for the good of Iran So it is this feeling of national unity you see it every in the Caspian I saw that in the Caspian as well Same thing So what you're saying is absolutely correct It's it's all over You cannot analyze Iran based on the differences between North Iran wealthy and South Iran proletarian No it's much more complex than that Exactly Let's see what would happen But I don't see anything What's what's what's your feeling Mima Ser without polit geopolitical analysis What's your feeling What's your feeling My feeling is what from what I'm hearing from inside from Iran as time goes by when these attacks are continuing on Iranian people.

polit geopolitical analysis What's your feeling What's your feeling My feeling is what from what I'm hearing from inside from Iran as time goes by when these attacks are continuing on Iranian people there are the unity is growing stronger among Iranian you see the all people those liberals that you've mentioned in the northern part of Thran coming together with the southern part of Thran with those villages in Iran all united I I can confess that Py I live in Brazil you know that and I do see the feeling when it comes to Iran the feeling that come came out of this attack on Iran unprovoked attack on Iran is is bringing something to the society that the society wasn't experiencing it since the war against Saddam Hussein there is something new happening inside the society and nobody knows they're gonna fight these these people would fight the United States to the last one to they they going to fight back and I I hope there is somebody in the United States hearing what's going on you.

they're gonna fight these these people would fight the United States to the last one to they they going to fight back and I I hope there is somebody in the United States hearing what's going on you know and seeing the reality of what's going on not through the propaganda these people who were who who were simply receiving money to manipulate the the analysis on their part from Iran These mostly Iranians who are living outside of Iran trying to give false pictures to the administration in the United States in Europe because they're receiving they're somehow they're puppets of many are being paid actually Yeah This is this is that's why I'm seeing this is totally dangerous This is dangerous I don't want to see any anything happening in that region We had a lot with Gaza with the Palestine with the case of and again they're trying to do it I don't see anything I don't see the United States winning I I see United States losing and losing big in the West Asia They're going to learn it if.

with the case of and again they're trying to do it I don't see anything I don't see the United States winning I I see United States losing and losing big in the West Asia They're going to learn it if they go with the attack on Iran They're going to learn it They're going to find something that has never happened before to the United States It's something big It's something big there there must be there shall be prepared they shall prepare for that in in my opinion it's yeah the only thing that I can say and but I don't see the sanity in the administration I was somehow hope I I was hoping that these people like like the vice president of the United States JD Vance would be the the voice of sanity he's not he's not he's is trying to he he's not doing anything Look at Tulsi Gabbard Look at we were talking about Cash Petal He who's unbelievable Unbelievable The worst thing with the Biden administration at least we know that they wouldn't let the Neta wanted to attack during the Biden.

at we were talking about Cash Petal He who's unbelievable Unbelievable The worst thing with the Biden administration at least we know that they wouldn't let the Neta wanted to attack during the Biden administration They didn't let him They didn't let him to attack But Trump administration is somehow we we had a lot of hope in the in the administration Mhm It's just gone All gone Everything you said makes total sense compared to what what I'm hearing the echoes I'm getting from Iraq Absolutely Uh and it's very impressive that in only a matter of few days people understand the bigger picture not only the unprovoked attack by Israel per se but everything that that implies and it's a camouflaging it's the same old imperial story They could never digest the Islamic Revolution with all the problems of the Islamic Revolution but it's it's ingrained in them They need revenge for what they lost and now they think that they have the this small window of opportunity and as you said correctly.

problems of the Islamic Revolution but it's it's ingrained in them They need revenge for what they lost and now they think that they have the this small window of opportunity and as you said correctly they will regret it Yeah Thank you so much Papy for being I wish we had more apicious things to talk about but that's it that this is this is our reality Yes Yeah Yeah It's hitting us See you in in Brazil See you see you soon in Brazil Okay Chowo chiao Cha Byebye.
