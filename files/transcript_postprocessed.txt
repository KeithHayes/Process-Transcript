Alice
Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study.
The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.
The silence wasn't just an absence of sound; it was its own entity—a companion that whispered softly, allowing thoughts to wander freely without interruption.
Outside the garden lay in gentle bloom.
Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness.
A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects amidst the wild clover.
Occasionally, Alice saw an orange-colored butterfly with black veins on its wings flutter by.
Adventures in
Wonderland... By Lewis Carroll
Lewis is my favorite author. He writes amazing books!
Carroll woke up early in the morning to the sound of horses' hooves clattering against the cobblestone streets outside his window. The bustling city was already alive with activity; carriage drivers shouted to one another as they navigated through the crowded thoroughfares.
Merchants hawked wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues filled the air.
As she read...
Alice imagined herself there; she could almost hear the clip-clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot.
The weight of her satchel on her shoulder, once more she closed her eyes. Letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses.
Until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality...
Such was the power of fine writing; it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.
By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely.
The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair.
Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth. The distance, a lone streetlamp flickered its orange glow; reflected off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs.
Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.
She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being. It was a practice in mindfulness—in appreciating the transition from the end of daylight to the arrival of evening, from narrative to reflection.
She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine—preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.
When she finally stood the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room.
Alice felt a gentle contentment and gratitude, even for the stories and for the silence that followed. She was grateful for the world beyond them and the tactile, living reality she inhabited.
So at the close of day, she gave thanks.
For words for solitude?
And for the small wonders...
That attend each ordinary moment!
