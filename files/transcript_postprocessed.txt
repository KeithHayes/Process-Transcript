Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study. The late-afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls. She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink. It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains. The silence wasn't merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itselfâ€”a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.
