Alice.
Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study.
The lateafternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating, endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning, pages , and  the subtle comfort of stories held within paper , and  ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations , and  endless email chains.
The silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itselfa companion that whispered in comfortable tones , and  allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.
Outside the garden lay in gentle bloom.
Roses of deep crimson , and  pale pink nodded in the early breeze , while  lavender , and  thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness.
A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking, at small insects among the wild clover.
Occasionally an orangewinged butterfly fluttered past the aging, glass , and .
Alice followed its slow drifting, flight for a moment before returning, to her book.
Such ordinary spectacles , when  observed with attention held a profound beauty?
It was a lesson she had learned early , and  oftenthe marvels of life are seldom grand , or  flashy they are small quiet , and  easily overlooked.
Her book an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century lay open on her lap.
The paper was slightly yellowed , but  sturdy the ink crisp.
Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time place , and  character.
There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actionstying, shoelaces pouring, tea gazing, out toward a stormy horizon.
Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life , and  it fascinated.
Alice how these small gestures could reveal , so  much about an individuals hopes fears , and  inner world?
In one story a young woman stood enchanted forest where time seemed to stand still , and  every creature spoke in riddles , and  rhymes?
Alice smiled softly remembering, how much she loved these stories , when  she was younger perhaps now was the perfect time to revisit them after all there was always something, new to discover within those magical pages early morning, in a busy city horsedrawn carriages rattled over cobblestones?
Merchants were hawking, wares at street stalls , and  the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues filled the air.
As she read.
Alice imagined herself there she could almost hear the clipclop of hooves , and  feel the rough stone underfoot.
The weight of her satchel on her shoulder once more she closed her eyes letting, the sounds , and  textures swirl around her senses.
Until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality.
Such was the power of fine writing, it created an illusion , so  vivid , so  grounded that the line between reader , and  narrator blurred.
By the time she finished the second story darkness had fallen completely.
The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair.
Beyond the window the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes , and  the glimmer of a single landing, moth the distance a lone streetlamp flickered to life its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves turning, them into luminous orbs.
Alice closed the anthology pressed a finger against the spine , and  slid the book into its place on the shelf.
She sat for a moment longer teacup in hand simply beingit was a practice in mindfulness in appreciating, transition the end of daylight , and  arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection.
She allowed herself this small pause before rising, to begin the next phase of her evening, routine preparing, a light supper writing, a few thoughtful entries in her journal , and  perhaps stepping, out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.
When she finally stood the teacup empty the anthology closed , and  the quiet settled deeply over the room?
Alice felt a gentle contentment gratitudeeven for the stories yes , and  for the silence that held them all together world.
