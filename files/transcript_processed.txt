alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itself a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden lay in gentle bloom
roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects among the wild clover
occasionally a butterfly orange with black veined wings fluttered past the aging glass and
alice followed its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book
such ordinary spectacles when observed with attention held a profound beauty
it was a lesson she had learned early and often that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy they are small quite and easily overlooked
her book an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century laid open on her lap
the paper was slightly yellowed but sturdy the ink crisp
each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time place and character
there was a certain charm in the way authors of that era weaved descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actionstying shoe laces pouring tea gazing out towards a stormy horizon
such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life and it fascinated
alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individuals hopes fears and in another part we have this beautifully written passage about natures beauty of honey
alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup the one painted with delicate blue forgetmenots
she paused to inhale the warm steam allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind
it had become something of a ritual this tea drinking ritual a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest there she could almost hear the clip clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot
the weight of her satchel rested heavily on her shoulder
again she closed her eyes allowing the sounds and textures to swirl around her senses
until she couldnt tell if they were hers or part of the tale being woven by the author
fine writing possessed such power creating an illusion so realistic the boundary separating reader and protagonist became indiscernible
as night fell completing the second chapter left her surrounded in near total darkness
only the warm glow emanated from the desk lamp provided any respite
its gentle radiance casting shadows crossed the room while highlighting the comforts within arms reach her trusty pen wellworn bookmark and steaming cup of tea were now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth
in the distance a lone street lamp flickered to life its orange glow reflected onto dewy leaves transforming them into luminescent orbs
with a gentle sigh
alice closed the anthology pressing a lovingly wrinkled finger against the spine before carefully placing it back on the shelf beside her bedside table
sitting there for another quiet minute with her teacup still clutched tightly between both hands she savoring these simple moments which marked not just an ending but also signalized new beginnings transitions from one state of consciousness to another
eventually after allowing herself this brief respite from
realitys demands she rose gracefully from where she had been sitting all alone amidst soft whispers of
nightfall creeping ever closer around her cozy little nook at
home
to begin the next phase of her
evening
routine
preparing a
light
supper
writing
a
few
thoughtful
entries
in
her
journal
and
perhaps
stepping
out
onto
the
back
porch
to
breath
beneath
a
sky
of
stars
when
she
finally
stood
the
tea
cup
empty
the
anthology
closed
and
the
quiet
settled
deeply
over
the
room
alice
felt
a
gentle
contentment 
gratitude
even
for
the
stories
yes
and
also
for
the
world
beyond
them
for
the
tactile
living
reality
she
inhabited
and
so
at
the
close
of
day
she
gave
thanks
for
words
solitude
and
the
small
wonders
that
attend
each
one an extraordinary event can happen in an ordinary moment like a butterfly flapping its wings causing a hurricane across the world
