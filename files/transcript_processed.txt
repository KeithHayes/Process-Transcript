alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the lateafternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itselfa companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden lay in gentle bloom
roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects among the wild clover
occasionally a butterflyorange with blackveined wingsfluttered past the aging glass
alice followed its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book
such ordinary spectacles when observed with attention held a profound beauty
it was a lesson she had learned early and oftenthat the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy they are small quiet and easily overlooked
her book an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century lay open on her lap
the paper was slightly yellowed but sturdy the ink crisp
each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time place and character
there was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actionstying shoelaces pouring tea gazing out toward a stormy horizon
such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life and it fascinated
alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individuals hopes fears and inner world
in one story a young woman alices actions were deliberate and methodical
she carefully placed the bookmark between the pages of her open book signaling a temporary pause in her reading
the sun was beginning to set outside casting an ethereal glow over the garden
as the day drew to a close
alice prepared herself for another evening spent immersed in literature
reaching for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her she filled her favorite cup adorned with delicate blue forgetmenots with steaming chamomile infusion laced with just a hint of honey
this soothing brew had become more than just a beverage it served as a transitional moment between the world of thoughts and dreams and the reality of rest
with her tea in hand
alice turned back to her anthology selecting a new tale to lose herself within early morning in a busy city horsedrawn carriages rattle over cobblestones
merchants hawk wares at street stalls and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues fills the air
as
alice reads she imagines herself there she can almost hear the clipclop of hooves and feel the rough stone beneath her feet
the weight of her satchel on her shoulder she closes her eyes allowing the sounds and textures to swirl around her senses
so vivid is this illusion that the line between reader and narrator becomes blurred
by the time she finishes the second story darkness has fallen completely
the study lamp casts a soft pool of light around her chair while outside the garden is now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a lone landing moth the distance a lone streetlamp flickered to life its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves turning them into luminous orbs
alice closed the anthology pressed a finger against the spine and slid the book into its place on the shelf
she sat for a moment longer teacup in hand simply beingit was a practice in mindfulness in appreciating transition the end of daylight and arrival of evening the movement from narrative to reflection
she allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine preparing a light supper writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars
when she finally stood the teacup empty the anthology closed and the quiet settled deeply over the room
alice felt a gentle contentment gratitudeeven for the storiesand for the silence that followed world

inhabits

so
at

solitude
and
for
