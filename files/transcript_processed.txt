alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the lateafternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence wasn't just an absence of noiseit was a presence too a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden laid in gentle blooms roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects amongst the wild clover
occasionally an orangeandblack winged butterfly flitted past the aged glass and
alice would follow its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book
such ordinary spectacles when observed with attention held a profound beautyit was a lesson she had learned early and often that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy they are small quiet and easily overlooked her bookan anthology of short stories from the early twentieth centurylaid open on her lap
the paper was slightly yellowed but sturdy the ink crisp
each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time place and character
there was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial events actions like tying shoe laces pouring tea gazing out towards a stormy horizon
such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life and it fascinated
alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual's hopes fears and inner world
in one story a young woman stood at the edge of a river watching the current drift by as if it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future
the description was simple she lifted her hands above her head letting the cool evening breeze play through her fingers
yet that image carried emotion enough to fill pages upon pagesa lifetime of longing
alice closed her eyes imagining the wind on her skin and for a moment she felt transported away from her studies to that riverside scene
then she opened her eyes again setting the bookmark between the pages and raised her gaze to the window the sun had sunk low the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold
soon the garden would blur into silhouettes and the air would cool
reaching for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her she poured herself a cup of its fragrant chamomile infusionwith just a hint of honeyinto her favorite cup the one painted with delicate blue forgetmenots
with that it became something of a ritual this teadrinking ritual a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest
turning back to her anthology she selected another storythis one describing an early morning in a bustling city horsedrawn carriages were rattling over cobblestone streets while merchants hawked their wares from street stalls the clamor of voices speaking in unfamiliar tongues filled the air
as she read aloud
alice could imagine herself there amongst it allshe could even hear the clipclop of hooves and feel the rough stone beneath her feet
the weight of her satchel resting on her shoulder made everything seem more realistic
she closed her eyes again to let the sounds and textures surround her senses entirely before opening them back up into reality
fine writing possessed such powerful imagery that it often felt like one's very existence became intertwined within its pages when at last night fell it cast shadows across every corner of the room leaving just enough light filtering through the windows for comfortable readingalone by then end of chapter two lay ahead waiting patiently upon her bedside table besidesleepy head reader ssnuggledeep insidedeepwarmblanketdreamingsweet dreamsoffar awayplacesfull wonderousadventuresawaitingdiscoverytomorrowsunrisebringanotherdayclosertoexploreunknownterritoriesshadowrealmsdefinedonlybytheglimpseofasinglelandingmoththeindistancealonestreelamphickereditsorangeglobrebouncedoffdeweyleavesturningtotheminto luminosorbesecondhandaliceclosedanthologyslippedfingeragainstspineguidebookintoplaceonshelftakeateapressedtea cupinsmileallowedthismomentbefore risingen to begin the next phase of her evening routine involved preparing a light supper writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe underneath a sky of stars
when she finally stood the tea cup empty the anthology was closed and the quiet settled deeply over the room
alice felt a gentle contentment gratitude even
for the storiesyesand for the world beyond them for the tactile living reality she inhabited
at the close of day she gave thanks for words for solitude and for the small wonders that attended each moment ordinary moments can be extraordinary if you take time to appreciate them
