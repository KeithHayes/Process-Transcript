alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itselfa companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden laid in gentle bloom
roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects among the wild clover
occasionally a butterflyorange with black veined wingsfluttered the formatted output should be like this alices
adventures in
wonderland by
lewis
carroll early morning in a busy city horsedrawn carriages rattled over cobblestones
merchants hawked wares at street stalls and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues filled the air
as she read
alice imagined herself there she could almost hear the clipclop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot
the weight of her satchel on her shoulder once more she closed her eyes letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses
until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality
such was the power of fine writing it created an illusion so vivid so grounded that the line between reader and narrator blurred
by the time she finished the second story darkness had fallen completely
the study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair
beyond the window the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth the distance a lone streetlamp flickered its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves turning them into luminous orbs
alice closed the anthology pressed a finger against the spine and slid the book into its place on the shelf
she sat for a moment longer teacup in hand simply beingit was a practice in mindfulness in appreciating transition the end of daylight and arrival of evening the movement from narrative to reflection
she allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine preparing a light supper writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars
when she finally stood the teacup empty the anthology closed and the quiet settled deeply over the room
alice felt a gentle contentment gratitude even for the storiesand for the silence that followed world beyond them for the tactile living reality she inhabits
so at the close of day she gave thanks 
for words for solitude
and for the small wonders
that attend each ordinary moment
