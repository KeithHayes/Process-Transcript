alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itself a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden lay in gentle bloom
roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air a pair of robins with fragrant sweetness hopped onto the low stone wall and began pecking at small insects amidst the wild clover
occasionally an
orange
butterfly would flutter by passing through the aged glass panes
alice watched this delicate creatures dance for just a brief moment before returning her focus back upon her reading material 
an
anthology filled exclusively with tales spun during those very same years which now seemed like yesterday themselves young woman stood at the edge of a river watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future
the description was simple she lifted her hands above her head letting the cool early spring wind play through her fingers
yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing
alice closed her eyes imagining the wind on her skin and for a moment she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene
then she opened her eyes again setting the bookmark between the pages and raised her gaze to the window
the sun had sunk lower the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold
soon the garden would be bathed in twilights soft glow the formatted output should be like below where every sentence is separated by periods or other appropriate punctuations she read
alice imagined herself there she could almost hear the clipclop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot the weight of her satchel on her shoulder
again she closed her eyes letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality
such was the power of fine writingit created an illusion so vivid so grounded that the line between reader and narrator blurred
by the time she finished the second story darkness had fallen completely
the study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair
beyond the window the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth
in the distance crickets chirped in unison like tiny violins playing a haunting melody a lonely street lamp flickered to life its orange glow reflected upon dew drops transforming them into luminescent orbs
alice carefully placed anthology closing it softly with an audible thud that echoed through the silent room
sitting still for another minute tea cup resting delicately between fingers eyes fixed upon nothing but thoughts drifting aimlessly within her head 
this is where serenity resides
in these moments when time stands still yet everything around you moves forward at breakneck speed
as darkness descends upon ushering in nightfall like clockwork precision so too does our heroine rise up ready take on whatever challenges lie ahead be they mundane chores such as cooking dinner or more profound endeavors involving selfreflection via penning down personal musings within pages bound by leather the cover was adorned by golden letters which read journal
after an age seemingly passed in wandering through cloudy heights far from any semblance of grounding or connection to her mundane life below she finally stood upright amidst warming amber light filling up the space around her its origin still unclear but slowly becoming more apparent as it grew stronger revealing itself eventually as nothing other than a simple window casti
