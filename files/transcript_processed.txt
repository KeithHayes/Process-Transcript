alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the lateafternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence wasnt just an absence of noiseit was a presence too a companion that whispered in familiar tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden laid in gentle bloom
roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hop atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects amongst the wild clover
occasionally an orangeandblack winged butterfly flits past the aged glassalice watches slowly drift away with interest before resuming reading her book upon her lap
this anthology contains tales from early twentieth century each meticulously chosen for accurate portrayal through vivid descriptions which weave together seemingly insignificant moments into captivating narratives like tying shoe laces becoming pauses filled by contemplative thoughts or sipping tea signaling deep reflection on lifes journey itself
these intricate details paint pictures richer than any grand gesture ever could unveiling characters hidden depths while also reflecting broader societal trends during those times
it is this appreciation towards minutiae that has always drawn
alice closer towards literature finding solace among pages documenting ordinary lives extraordinary experiences
a young woman stood at the edge of a river watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future
the description was simple yet it held emotions enough to fill a lifetime of longing
alice closed her eyes imagining the wind on her skin feeling herself being transported away from her studies to that riverside scene
with a deep breath she set the bookmark between the pages and looked up towards the window
outside the sun had sunk low into the horizon painting the sky in an array of ethereal shades lavenders and golds blending seamlessly together until everything seemed almost surreal
in no time at all nightfall would descend upon them like a cloak draped over sleepy shoulders soon afterwards darkness would envelope even this tranquil corner of suburbia it would blur into silhouettes and the air would cool
she reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her
it held a fragrant chamomile infusionwith just a hint of honey
alice poured the steaming liquid into her favourite cup the one painted with delicate blue forgetmenots
pausing to inhale the warm steam she allowed its gentle scent to settle her mind
it had become something of a ritual this tea drinking ritual a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest
turning back to her anthology she selected a different story
this one described an early morning in a busy city horsedrawn carriages rattled over cobblestone streets merchants hawked wares at street stalls and the clamour of voices filled the air in unfamiliar tongues she read
alice imagined herself thereshe could almost hear the clipclop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot
the weight of her satchel hung heavily on her shoulder
again she closed her eyes letting the sounds and textures swirl around her sensitive senses
until she couldnt tell if what she felt were hers alone anymore
fine writing held such power to create an illusion so vivid so tangible that even the lines separating reader and narrator seemed to fade away into obscurity
when at last did finish reading through both stories
darkness fell upon everything outside like a heavy curtain drawn shut for good measure against any remaining daylight left hanging precariously beyond its edge inside though still lit up bright enough thanks largely due solely because one small desk lamp standing sentry over near corner casts out just barely sufficient amount of warm yellowishwhite artificial illumination needed allowing a young girl to continue perusing pages with print in black letters set off by crisp clean stark whitenesspage after endless seemingly interminable page
right up until that moment arrives when she looks back again toward the clock ticking steadily away relentlessly marking the passage of times seconds minutes hours days weeks monthsyears never stopping nor slowing down regardless of however slowly at times progress may have been made thus far along what seems like an eternal stretch of roadway flanked only by darkness save for those rare occasions upon which some distant lonely streetlamps would flicker briefly awake emitting feeble bursts of dimmed orange hue reflected dully yet somehow magically transformed nearby foliage into ethereal luminescent spheres resembling precious jewelsglinting softly amidst velvety nighttime gloominess enveloping everything around within its cloak concealing secretsuntold mysteries waiting patiently whispering promises hinting possibilities offering hope to inspired dreamers like our fair protagonist herein before described
she had just finished reading through another captivating chapter from her beloved book collection which lay beside one another on the bedside table glowing with promise beneath the faint light cast by an oldfashioned lamp post
with great care and affection she placed this latest addition next to the others watching fondly as they seemed almost alive with anticipation for what adventures might lie ahead when read once more during some far off evening soon enough
