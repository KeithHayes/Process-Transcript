alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itself a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered had been selected for its faithful representation of time place and character
there was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actionstying shoelaces pouring tea gazing out toward a stormy horizon
such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life and it fascinated
alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individuals hopes fears and inner world transported away from her study to that riverside scene then she opened her eyes again setting the bookmark between the pages and raised her gaze to the window
the sun had sunk lower the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold
soon the garden would blur into silhouettes and the air would cool
she reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her
it held a fragrant chamomile infusion with just a hint of honey
alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup the one painted with delicate blue forgetmenots
she paused to inhale the warm steam allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind
it had become something of a ritual this teadrinking ritual a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest
turning back to her anthology she selected a different story
this one described an enchanted forest where fairies danced beneath the moonlight early morning in a busy city horsedrawn carriages rattling over cobblestones merchants hawking wares at street stalls and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues
as she read
alice imagined herself there she could almost hear the clipclop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot
the weight of her satchel on her shoulder
again she closed her eyes letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality
such was the power of fine writing it created an illusion so vivid so grounded that the line between reader and narrator blurred
by the time she finished the second story darkness had fallen completely
the study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair
beyond the window the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth the distance a lone streetlamp flickered to life
its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves turning them into luminous orbs
alice closed the anthology pressed a finger against the spine and slid the book into its place on the shelf
she sat for a moment longer teacup in hand simply being
it was a practice in mindfulness in appreciating transition the end of daylight and arrival of evening the movement from narrative to reflection
she allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine preparing a light supper writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars
when she finally stood the teacup empty the anthology closed and the quiet settled deeply over the room
alice felt a gentle contentment
gratitude even for the stories
and for the silence world beyond them for the tactile living reality she inhabits and so at the close of day she gave thanks for words for solitude and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment
