alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the lateafternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itselfa companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden lay in gentle bloom
roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects among the wild clover
occasionally an orangewinged butterfly fluttered past the aging glass and
alice followed its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book
such ordinary spectacles when observed with attention held a profound beauty
it was a lesson she had learned early and oftenthe marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy they are small quiet and easily overlooked
her book an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century lay open on her lap
the paper was slightly yellowed but sturdy the ink crisp
each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of human experiencelove loss joy sorrow and everything in between
as
alice turned another page she felt herself drawn into the world of these characters once again finding solace in their struggles and triumphs
time place and characterthere was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions tying shoe laces pouring tea gazing out toward a stormy horizon
such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life and it fascinated
alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individuals hopes fears and inner world
one story had a young woman standing enchanted in a forest where time seemed to stand still and every creature spoke in riddles and rhymes
alice smiled softly as she began reading about these whimsical creatures who lived within the confines of a magical worldso unlike hers yet somehow familiar like old friends waiting patiently for her return
when she finished the tale she set down the book feeling content but also yearning for more than just stories
she looked out toward the garden once again now bathed in warm sunlight and thought perhaps she would take up painting again soon
twilights glow inspired wishes upon another star hoping against hope that maybe someday she might find herself walking along paths less traveled exploring lands unknown seeking adventure and wonder beyond the pages of books
early morning in a busy city horsedrawn carriages rattled over cobblestones merchants were hawking wares at street stalls and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues filled the air
as she read
alice imagined herself there she could almost hear the clipclop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot
the weight of her satchel on her shoulder once more
by the time she finished the second story darkness fell and she found herself lost in thought wondering what other wonders laid ahead
had she fallen completely under the spell of the study lamps soft pool of light around her chair
beyond the window the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth
the distance a lone streetlamp flickered to life its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves turning them into luminous orbs
alice closed the anthology pressed a finger against the spine and slid the book into its place on the shelf
she sat for a moment longer tea cup in hand simply being
it was a practice in mindfulness in appreciating the transition the end of daylight and arrival of evening the movement from narrative to reflection
allowing herself this small pause she rose to begin the next phase of her evening routine preparing a light supper writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath the stars a sky of stars when she finally stood the teacup empty the anthology closed
the quiet settled deeply over the room
alice felt a gentle contentment gratitude even for the stories yes and for the silence that held them all together
worlds beyond them for the tactile living reality she inhabited and so at the close of day she gave thanks for words for solitude and for the small wonders that attended each ordinary moment
