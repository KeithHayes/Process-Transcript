alice warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study the late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless and often that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy they are small quiet and easily overlooked her book an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century lay open on her lap the paper was slightly yellowed but sturdy the ink crisp each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time place and character there was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove future the description was simple she lifted her hands above her head letting the cool early spring wind play through her fingers yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing alice closed her eyes imagining the wind on her skin and for a moment she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene then she opened her eyes again setting the bookmark between the pages and raised her gaze she paused to inhale the warm steam allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind it had become something of a ritual this tea drinking ritual a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest turning back to her anthology she selected a different story this one described an early morning in a busy city horse drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones merchants hawking wares at street stalls and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar and narrator blurred by the time she finished the second story darkness had fallen completely the study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair beyond the window the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth in the distance a lone streetlamp flickered to life its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves turning them into luminous orbs alice closed the anthology pressed in her journal and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars when she finally stood the teacup empty the anthology closed and the quiet settled deeply over the room alice felt a gentle contentment gratitude even for the stories yes and for the world beyond them for the tactile living reality she inhabits and so at the close of day she gave thanks for words for solitude and  the room alice felt a gentle
