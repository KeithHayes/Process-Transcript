alice warren sat beside a wide
window in the corner of her study the
late afternoon light slanted gently
across the hardwood floor illuminating
endless rows of books that lined the
walls she loved the hush of quiet
contemplation the soft rustle of
turning pages and the subtle comfort
of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she
found solace after a long day of
meetings presentations and endless
email chains the silence wasnt 
just an absence of noise it was a

the silence wasnt just an absence of noise it was a
presence in itself a companion that
whispered in comfortable tones and
allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden fragrant with sweetness featured a pair of robins hopping atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects among the wild clover occasionally an orange and black veined
butterfly would flutter past the aged glass
and alice followed its slow drifting
flight for a moment before returning
to her book such ordinary spectacles

such ordinary spectacles
when observed with attention held a
profound beauty it was a lesson she
had learned early and often that the
mundane and seemingly insignificant aspects of life possessed a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions like tying shoelaces pouring tea or gazing out towards a stormy horizon such attentiveness to 
detail formed a tapestry of everyday
life it fascinated alice how these
small gestures could reveal so much
about an individuals hopes fears and
inner world
within the context of a single story a young woman stood at the
edge of a river

it was late afternoon as alice sat curled up on her cozy armchair by the window engrossed in an old collection of short stories she marveled at how these seemingly insignificant actions like pouring herself some tea or selecting another tale to read could offer such profound insight into human nature with each turn of page she found herself immersed deeper into the lives of characters who were once strangers but now felt familiar their joys and sorrows resonating deeply within her own heart as dusk began to fall outside casting long shadows across the room she closed the book marking her place before reaching for her cup of chamomile infused tea

as dusk began to fall outside casting long shadows across the room she closed the book marked her place and reached for her cup of chamomile infused tea and rest turning back to her anthology she selected a different story this one described an early morning in a busy city horse drawn carriages rattling over cobblestone streets merchants hawking their wares at street stalls and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues as alice read she imagined herself there she could almost hear the clip clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot the weight of
her satchel and stepping out
onto the back porch to breathe beneath
a sky of stars
when she finally stood the teacup
empty the anthology closed and the
quiet settled deeply over the room
alice felt a gentle contentment
gratitude even for the stories yes and
for the world beyond them for the
tactile living reality she inhabited
and so at the close of day she gave
thanks for words for solitude and for
the small wonders that attended each
ordinary moment
