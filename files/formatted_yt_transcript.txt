Pepe Escobar: Hello everyone, it's great to be here with you all today. As we speak, tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate, with multiple stakeholders vying for dominance over strategic resources such as oil reserves and waterways like the Persian Gulf. In this context, recent movements of US military assets near Iran raise concerns about potential aggression against Tehran; however, given past experience, one cannot discount the possibility of these actions being part of a larger geopolitical chess game aimed at keeping adversaries off balance. At the same time, international forums like St Petersburg play crucial roles in facilitating dialogue between different regions

The reason being, it's more about doing business compared to Davos. In fact, this morning, the organizers announced that around $80 billion worth of deals have been signed in St. Petersburg, which is huge by any standard. Moreover, these are global South deals involving Africa, India, Pakistan, Southeast Asia, Russia, China, etc. , with everyone present discussing various projects related to trade and commerce. Even though there might be some controversies surrounding such events due to geopolitical tensions or corruption issues,.

The main topic here is still very relevant. Governments from various regions including Russia are discussing potential projects involving foreign investment. These discussions include representatives from different industries and levels of government who acknowledge both positive outcomes and challenges associated with these partnerships. While acknowledging caution expressed by certain individuals on stage regarding pace of change, Paul Batista—a prominent figure within the context of today’s conversation—emphasized urgency around necessary reforms within the current international financial structure. According to Paulo, delay.

Paulo, one of the founders of the MDB new development bank, believes that there needs to be a structural reform within the NDP. However, both Russia and China are lacking in this area. Discussions like these can only happen at a forum such as this. In his panel on fake news, they discussed topics ranging from controlling information to artificial intelligence and how digital production will soon be used to create even more falsehoods. It was mentioned by an executive from the largest Russian bank that fake news isn't just limited to their country; it's becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Additionally, they touched upon Palanteur—a prominent AI company currently working closely with

> Name: Edward Snowden
>> Content: Additionally, they touched upon Palantech — a prominent AI company currently working closely with Israel. The issue here is how serious this situation really is when these same people who created such technology could potentially use it against others. For instance, some individuals at Palantech have been accused of creating algorithms used by Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians during conflict situations. This highlights the potential dangers posed by unregulated development and deployment of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). In response to this concern, there has been growing interest within civil society groups towards establishing global standards for ethical usage of AI systems. An initiative led by Global Fact-

Checks promotes accountability among technology companies regarding their products' impact on human rights. The conversation around these issues often leads back to the influence exerted by large corporations like those associated with the former Pay Pal Mafia members, who have since become influential figures in the U. S. Government. At the World Economic Forum, held annually in Davos, Switzerland, there has been an increased focus on addressing real-world problems through technological innovation. Panels featuring experts from various fields.

"Putin: Southeast Asia and Africa are two top areas for development in the near future. "

These people who are peddling this notion; they are provocateurs. Provocator - literal translation from Russian. This means we can infer that, of course, they are helping discreetly Iran. In fact, this has been so since before. We cannot discuss this publicly. When I asked people close to the government about it, no answers were given. Therefore, we discussed this issue further with think tank members such as professors at universities. The response provided by them was quite similar to what I heard during my visit to Yemen where I spoke with a member of the High Political Council regarding their relationship with both.

Speaker: "Reformat this transcript with strict rules. "

Speaker: Name: content It seems like there's an opportunity here right? Like we should be able to create jobs and improve lives through these types of investments but unfortunately due to political instability and conflict in the region many potential partnerships have been put on hold Until recently when several local entrepreneurs approached me about their desire for collaboration Despite facing numerous challenges such as language barriers logistical hurdles and lack of recognition within Western circles these individuals remain optimistic about the future prospects for business growth and development Not only do they believe in the potential of their own initiatives but also hope that other nations will soon follow suit leading to increased trade relations and overall progress Within our conversation one individual shared how they had

From Astrakan for instance which is part of the international north south transportation corp they love talking to foreign uh journalists and analysts because they are of course you know it's for them partnerships So this is just to give you and our audience a small glimpse of how important this forum was Even all of us hostages of this absolutely horrendous situation in West Asia You have over 10,000 people over there for three days non-stop networking and doing business So this is the future and it's not it's no wonder that one of the most important quotes from Putin during his plenary session is that he said we uh not only uh we Russia we are betting on bricks as the future but we are betting on the constitution of a new growth model with everything that implicates new growth model something completely different to what we have since 1945 When it comes to you mentioned the situation in in the Middle East in the West Asia between Iran and Israel was discussed How as as I mentioned in my first question h what is the latest development in the region How do you find in the west When you look at the mainstream media in the west they're saying Iran was defeated Iran was destroyed and.

Alexander Dugin: Correct me if I am wrong but when it comes to your analysis of the situation in particular in the region or in general international relations who would you say has been winning lately? Is it China is it Russia maybe Brazil maybe India probably some other countries as well But anyway who would you say has been winning recently? And why do you think so?

China or Russia may also be involved, along with possibly others too. However, considering their recent successes, which country do you believe has been winning lately? The United States is very insular compared to European nations that attempt global interaction. They repeatedly refer to themselves as 'exceptional', having a 'shining city upon the hill'. These attitudes lead them astray from truly comprehending important aspects such as decision-making processes within Iran, identifying its threats, neighbor relationships, regional alliances and historical context leading up to potential conflicts like those involving Iran and the West. Additionally, influential individuals within America fail to grasp fundamental differences between societies due to preconceived biases; thus creating false expect

Ations. Said Hersh, who was one of my role models as an investigative journalist when I was growing up. However, there's a problem with Sai because he knows too much about Western Asia from being an investigative journalist based in Washington D. C. , where he can easily access anyone through his vast network of contacts within the Industrial Military Complex and Zionist circles surrounding Washington Virginia and Maryland. In his recent article on his substack, he reproduces information given by these sources regarding their long-standing desire for regime change in Iran since at least 19.

Mike Pompeo stated in an interview recently published on Substack that there has been a long-standing desire for regime change in Iran among certain individuals within the United States government. The specific goal mentioned was the elimination of Islamic Republic of Iran's ballistic missile program, citing its potential to cause destruction similar to that seen during the U. S. -led invasion of Iraq. This commentary highlights both the frightening lack of understanding displayed by these officials as well as their alarmingly high levels of influence over important decisions being made in Washington D. C. , particularly when considering their interviews with reputable news outlets such as CNN and Fox News. Furthermore, the fact that these same individuals continue

Nima: Particularly when considering their interviews with reputable news outlets such as CNN and Fox News. Furthermore, the fact that these same individuals continue taking one month for the Houthis to destroy proves how quickly they could be defeated and humiliated by the IRGC. However, repeating this would be a terrible mistake. 
It's concerning because although they aren't entirely ignorant or unintelligent, they are radicalized and misguided. Their holdings of authority only amplify this issue further. Thus, it serves an important purpose for someone like Max Blumenthal to shed light on these beliefs through publications like The Grayzone Project.

Max Blumenthal has done an excellent job shedding light on these beliefs through his publication, The Grayzone Project. It's clear that nobody fears the Israeli military anymore; they've lost both strategically and morally. Even though they're still capable of committing atrocities without consequence, everyone knows their true nature as a killing machine. However, trying to maintain credibility against a powerful opponent such as Iran will only result in further humiliation. Despite initial successes due to their technological advancements, there remain critical vulnerabilities within their air defense systems that could potentially be addressed through Russian assistance - something Vladimir Putin has previously mentioned offering but was declined by Iran for now.

Vladimir Putin stated he had provided an offer to assist Iran in addressing gaps within their air defense system; however, it appears as though this proposal was rejected for now since the Iranians claimed they didn't require such support currently. Despite continuous attacks from Israel including multiple daily strikes via missiles and targeted killings amongst others – resulting in severe damage across various cities including Tel Aviv – the devastation caused cannot compare to what might happen should more advanced weaponry be deployed against Israeli targets. For instance, following recent events where Haifa sustained heavy losses due to rocket fire causing widespread destruction throughout the city while also impacting its crucial port infrastructure heavily damaged during combat

Haifa has suffered significant damage from rocket fire recently, leading to extensive destruction across the city as well as critical port infrastructure being heavily damaged during combat. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which plays a major role in protecting Iran against potential threats like Israel, has had to adapt their strategies within just 48 hours after these incidents occurred due to the urgent need for response measures. While both countries have experienced devastating consequences from these attacks, Iran appears to be more affected overall given how quickly they were able to disrupt nearly half of Israel's economic system - including vital institutions such as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. , the Wisemen Institute, and Unit 820

Major General Gavin Marks: These gangsters don't understand the complexities involved here. The Wiseman Institute, Unit 820. . . We have some information suggesting that Iran might be behind these attacks, but it's far from conclusive. As for these criminals, well, let's just say that their limited understanding of geopolitics could lead them down a dangerous path. If the US were to launch four B2 bombers carrying four bombs each to strike four different targets simultaneously, it would indeed change the game entirely. However, pulling off such a feat requires near-perfect coordination and visibility - something highly unlikely given the chaos following an initial attack. Can you

George Soros: Near perfect coordination and visibility are required for pulling off such a feat, which seems highly unlikely due to the chaos following an initial attack. However, Donald Trump may still believe he can succeed despite these challenges. Nevertheless, it is clear that those truly controlling the situation will continue pushing towards military action regardless of Trump's personal beliefs or desires. This leaves him in a difficult position where he risks losing support from both sides – those advocating for war and those opposed – potentially leading to impeachment attempts before the upcoming midterm elections.

They might advance to try to impeach him again so it's woah. The accumulation of horrors and absurdities is never-ending, right? And when you of course. . . all of us who, for professional reasons, we have to acknowledge. . . it's like the President of the United States is god; he can decide one day to do this or that. He decides the future of the world. No, he doesn't decide anything

Kab: It's like the President of the United States is god; he can decide one day to do this or that. He decides the future of the world.
Alex Christoforou: No, he doesn't decide anything. The next few months will be much more difficult unless both sides compromise, while keeping their eyes open for any potential opportunities arising from negotiations between Moscow and Kiev's backers regarding existing agreements already in place. There are always two sides to every story, including some positive ones amidst these dark times.

Dr. Rim: Well, there's always two sides to every story. Even during these difficult times, there can be some positives as well. When dealing with Israel, Putin points out that they have over one and a half million dual-passport holding former Soviet or Russian citizens residing in Israel who speak Russian fluently. Therefore, in certain ways, Israel too is part of Russia's sphere of influence. Although Putin's stance on Ukraine might seem rigid, he carefully considers all factors before making significant decisions due to his background as a lawyer and strategic planner. However, he won't compromise his belief that Iran remains an important ally for Russia; they share common

John: Well, he won't compromise his belief that Iran remains an important ally for Russia; they share common interests, holy grail in front of them - regime change in Iran. Which once again seems to be their ultimate goal despite denials otherwise. However, so far, there are no signs indicating any progress towards achieving this aim. In fact, the recent events suggest that America's primary focus has shifted elsewhere rather than pursuing regime change in Tehran.

It took years for the whole thing to collapse and it only collapsed because they distributed a lot of money to Saddam's generals. Now, Iran is solid, even though there are pockets of opposition among the upper-middle class who long for Iran under the Shah. However, after being attacked directly, the nation is united against foreign interference. Unfortunately, many in Washington lack understanding or knowledge about Iran's complex society, history, and culture. Their simplistic approach revolves around eliminating certain individuals while failing to grasp the diversity within.

Dmitry Medvedev said on his official Telegram channel that Moscow needs new hypersonic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads amid growing tensions over Ukraine. Their simplistic approach revolves around eliminating certain individuals while failing to grasp the diversity within. Dmitry Medvedev added that these missiles were needed due to NATO's expansion towards Russian borders.

Victor Gao from China said, "Go is very good. " In terms of if the United States attacks Iran as an act of self-defense and defending others, and if the US chooses to team up with Israel to initiate an offensive against Iran, then history would record that America was standing on the side of justice while China supports its ally no matter what.

Victor: Well, according to international law, every nation including Iran has the legitimate right to use force or military action only when it faces threat to its national security. However, if the U. S. initiates an attack against Iran without provocation, then it becomes the aggressor state itself. Therefore, we hope that the American leaders will exercise restraint and refrain from taking actions that could escalate tensions further. We also believe that dialogue and diplomacy are always preferable over violence.

Beijing and all that but this is their position and it's implied that if that happens they will help Iran in ways that none of us can imagine what would be the Chinese way of course discreet made in hate They don't talk about it We We've seen that in Ukraine We know how they act and they they don't talk about it Even with with the case of Russia Iran when Iran was somehow sending drones to Russia nobody was talking about it You remember that These countries are helping each other without talking about it Unlike what the United States and Europeans do Uh yes because they are masters of uh narrative twisting and blah blah blah And Russia Iran and China they have interlocked strategic partnerships It's on a completely different level There's no comparison Civilization states who have interlocking strategic partnerships and have the same interest and they are all on board on the main theme of the forum of St Petersburg until yesterday the construction of an integrated Eurasia and they are the three top actors We cannot say India is one of the top actors Definitely not By the way there are not many in there there was um yes there was a sizable Indian delegation in St St Petersburg but.

Joe Biden: Yes let me explain that Beijing and all that but this is their position and it's implied that if that happens they will help Iran in ways that none of us can imagine what would be the Chinese way of course discreetly. Made in hate, They don't talk about it. We've seen that in Ukraine. We know how they act and they, they don't talk about it. Even with with the case of Russia/Iran, when Iran was somehow sending drones to Russia, nobody was talking about it. You remember that? 
These countries are helping each other without talking about it. Unlike what the United States and Europeans do.

Set up a meeting with Iran in Estanul but it didn't work Supreme leader Yeah refused to talk with the United States But we know that the Iranian foreign minister went to Europe He talked with foreign the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom together with Germany and France The outcome of that those talks they were they were just repeating the same sort of demands on the part of the United States No enrichment even they want to bring in the missile the the missile program of Iran Unbelievable I don't know if it seems as time goes by Iran sees no solution but fight in the United States Yes Uhhuh The Shihuawas uh you saw the Shihu were demanding zero enrichment Who the hell are the Shihu to demand anything from a sovereign nation Especially because these imbeciles were part of the original JCPOA Germany was an observer in JCPOA It was the P uh was P3 plus one that was called Yeah Uh yeah I think P3+ one Germany was part of uh Vienna I can't believe that Well okay let's say that they had slightly less imbecile leaderships at the time Okay which is true technically In fact it was B5 plus one if I'm not I'm sorry Nema Yes P5+1 the five of the UNC plus German And now they Okay zero.

Nima: Yep. So there has been some discussions set up a meeting with Iran in Estanul but it didn't work. Supreme leader Yeah refused to talk with the United States. But we know that the Iranian foreign minister went to Europe. He talked with Foreign Ministers of the UK and the US together with Germany and France. The outcome of those talks were they were just repeating the same sort of demands on the part of the United States - no enrichment, even they want to bring in the missile program of Iran. Unbelievable. I don't know. As time goes by, it seems like Iran sees no solution but fight against the United States. Right?
Sh

We are seeing them build up their arsenal while we deplete our own interceptors. They are getting rid of all their older missiles. The ones who may be losing here are us. This is a very smart move on their part. It makes perfect sense. Their strategy has been working so far, and we should expect more of the same.

United States: Yeah, I mean, you know, having ideas about Russia. . . There are similarities, and this is something that they can discuss at the highest level - strategic level, Ministry of Defense level, and all that. You know, we’re sort of like at war yes? It's the same war, just in two different theaters, with the same backers on the other side and with the same objectives. Objective Number One is to pl.

Absolutely our friend Sergey Glazia have uh he he gave the short version of we are discussing now and he said and level three was u Ukraine so it didn't work so they are on level four level four is go against Iran and level five will be against China we are on level we are entering level four now absolutely and they are desperate because there's nothing they can do in terms of level three they're going to start a nuclear war against Russia they will lose Do they have what it takes to attack Russia No they don't in every aspect Are they going to accept that they are have been strategically defeated by Russia No they won't Will that change anything No it won't So okay you change the subject which is exactly where we are now They changed the subject Okay regime change in Iran Let's see if it works No it won't work So they'll be even more desperate after that What are what they're going to do False flag in Taiwan So you know when you put this all when you follow the process you put this all together you see the level of desperation Nema of these people because usually when we have a situation like this in the world okay the solution is a war to reset the system is what happened from.

Sergey Glazyev: . . . and they said. . . And then level four was go against Iran, and level five would be against China. We are on level four now; we are entering level four now. Absolutely.
Andrew Korybko: Regime change in Iran? Let's see if it works.

Andrew Korybko: We are on level four now; we are entering level four now. Absolutely. Regime change in Iran? Let's see if it works. He cannot move forward from the past but he cannot move into the future because he's encumbered by all the horrors of the past in front of him. Sometimes when he looks ahead, he sees a glimmer of hope, like perhaps changing the regime in Iran could work out well despite its complicated nature - filled with unimaginable suffering and horrors. Even those who seem victorious must ultimately pay a heavy price for historical events - as evidenced by Russia's economic rise after their struggles during the '9

People often believe that victory comes without consequence or sacrifice. However, history has proven otherwise. For instance, despite its current economic prosperity, Russia faced significant challenges following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. This serves as an example that no matter how successful one may seem at present, future obstacles cannot be ruled out entirely. Therefore, perhaps from within these trials lies potential for transformation – like a phoenix rising from the ashes. In relation to your question regarding whether I will ask America to cease their support of Israeli aggression against Palestinians, my answer remains unchanged; while it might appear difficult given the current situation where Israel seems to hold more power over others

Speaker: USA Tomorrow, when asked about cutting ties with Saudi Arabia due to its human rights abuses, Trump stated, “I have to take a lot of other things into consideration. ” Do you agree or disagree with this statement? 
Narrator: While it may seem challenging considering the current circumstances where Saudi Arabia appears powerful, the Green Party is prepared and has communicated with Iran. The outcome remains uncertain.

Raymond Davis: We don’t know how the US-Saudi relationship will play out regarding potential attacks against Iran or any other country. The outcome remains uncertain. Our friends who are experienced in the deep state can explain it quickly, but would President Trump listen? It seems unlikely even if someone did manage to get through to him about these matters. After all, bringing their fighter jets into Saudi Arabia doesn't make sense as far as launching an attack goes; doing so would mean destroying allies like Saudi Arabia along with enemies such as Iran itself—which wouldn't benefit America at all. "

". course and they have of course and they have diplomatic dialogue all of them Iran is talking Saudi Arabia Iran is talking to Qatar with UAE Everybody knows that and obviously they are terrified it decision It will be not a Tel Aviv decision will be a Washington decision. So it's the empire that will decide which vessels I am going to use for this operation. "

Tulsi Gabbard: If we were to do that, it would mean that there was no longer any pretense of adherence to international law, and as president, I believe that is a dangerous precedent that could have significant consequences for our nation moving forward. So while I understand the concerns around Iran's actions, including their support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah and their destabilizing activities in the region, I firmly believe that engaging in acts of war without congressional approval is unconstitutional and irresponsible.

" 
Trump: "Absolutely. Well, once again, he's caught in a net, in a very elaborate trap set up by the Zionist axis. They're another expendable U. S. President. If his presidency implodes because of an out-of-control stupid adventure in Iran, the Zionist axis will continue, and they will find.

> Name: Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya
> Content: Well if there was any doubt whether or not the West including NATO member states were truly committed to trying their best to overthrow Bashar al Assad in Syria they should now understand that those doubts are completely unfounded There can be absolutely no question regarding the intentions behind Western policy towards Syria The intention from the very beginning has been to weaken Syria enough so as to allow for regime change through various means possible This includes supporting opposition groups both domestically within Syria itself and also abroad particularly neighboring Turkey Qatar Saudi Arabia and Jordan providing funding training logistics military intelligence and foreign mercenaries One thing though that many seem

> Name: Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya
> Content: If there was any doubt that the West, including NATO members, were truly committed to removing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, these doubts must now be seen as entirely unfounded. From the start, the clear intention has been to weaken Syria until such time as a regime change could be effected by various means available. These include supporting domestic opposition groups inside Syria as well as external forces like neighbouring Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan; providing them with funds, training, logistics, military intelligence, and foreign mercenaries. However, some may argue that China and Russia appear to be watching events

Name: Marandi I agree with you. The Iranian people are very patriotic and won’t let anyone threaten them. However, some might argue that China and Russia seem to be observing the situation closely. While they wouldn't be able to challenge the US militarily, they could certainly influence global oil prices which would hurt both parties involved. Ultimately, any conflict between Iran and the US would lead to catastrophic consequences for everyone involved - especially innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. It's crucial that diplomatic efforts continue in order to deescalate tensions and find peaceful solutions moving forward.

The United States should focus on engaging with Iran through dialogue rather than military action. Administration officials should prioritize communication channels with Iranian leaders to prevent misunderstandings from escalating into conflict. Additionally, it may be beneficial for international organizations like the UN Security Council to intervene and facilitate negotiations between both parties involved.

These are smart people who understand their arguments clearly. They should engage in constructive dialogue instead of escalating tensions further.

Hat's absolutely correct. It's not just about being rich or poor; it's much more complex than that. Exactly. We need to look at other factors too.

Hussein: There's something new happening inside the society and nobody knows they're gonna fight these these people would fight the United States to the last one to they they going to fight back and I hope there is somebody in the United States hearing what's going on you know and seeing the reality of what's going on not through the propaganda these people who were who who were simply receiving money to manipulate the the analysis on their part from Iran. These mostly Iranians who.

Tulsi Gabbard: These mostly Iranian protesters are really going after their own government right now. And states seem to be losing big in the Middle East. If they go ahead with an attack on Iran, they will regret it because they haven't learned their lesson yet. There's something big coming that America hasn't experienced before; they need to get ready for it. Unfortunately, based on current events, I don't see any signs of rational thinking within the Biden administration regarding foreign policy matters such as diplomacy or peace negotiations. Even though some individuals may share those values privately, publicly speaking out against aggressive actions seems unlikely due to political pressure within Washington D. C. .

The current situation regarding Iran policy appears complicated, particularly given the ongoing tensions between the United States and other nations in Washington D. C. , which can lead to significant political pressures influencing decisions made there. Despite these challenges, many individuals share similar values when it comes to addressing aggression; however, speaking out publicly against such actions may not be feasible due to the potential consequences associated with doing so within this particular context. This dynamic has been evident throughout history – including during past conflicts involving Israel – where countries struggle to reconcile their desire for peace with competing interests or ideologies at play domestically or internationally. Ultimately, any escalation of military action should be approached cautiously
