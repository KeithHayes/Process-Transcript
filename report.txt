Current status:   

While formatted_transcript is generated the content is corrected to be in coherent sentences that use periods, 
commas, and capital letters as requirementts dictate.

The purpose of the LLM is to translate a raw audio transcript into an essay format that has paragraphs and gramatically correct 
sentences. Headings where appropriate.  Paragraphs and headings are separated by a blank line.  Do not use connecting dashes.  
Connecting dashes can be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and the capital letter of 
a new sentence as appropriate if grammar cannot make the transition with an appropriate connecting word.

Current output is not formattted.  This does not meet requirements.  I seen no capital letters or punctation 
marks or paragraphs.  They should all be there.  A file showing sample output is 'desired_output.txt'

The document is split into multiple chunks with overlap making smooth transitions in the output. Each time a chunk is 
processed a command line entry should show a new call has been made to the llm witth the chunk.  The sample transcript is several chunks 
long but current output does not show that it is.

Dignose the problem.

Design :

Transistions are smooth because the chumking connects already formatted sections as it builds output.  
Overlap where fresh lines are added supplies a leading edge of formated overlap so the chunk being 
formatted can be made to ttransition correct so that the connection is later correct.

example.  If a chunk is 1000 characters long the second chunnk would begin at 800 characters so the 
first 200 characters are formattted with previous content.  This overlap allows the overlap to be 
rewritten when the second chunk overwrites the tail of the first chunk.

The end of the second chunk is at 1800 so the third chunk begins at 1600 to repeat the overlap 
re-write process until a smooth translation of the entire file has been accomplished.

This should be a common technique to process a translation in chunks and the web should be 
consulted as needed to ensure logic is correct.

Chunking will have to be along word boundaries because of the nature of the continuous transcript.   

The overlap is intended to fix problems with chunking in the middle of a sentence or paragraph.

Hi everybody. Today is Saturday, June 21st, 2025, and our friend Pepe Escobar is back with us. Welcome back, Pepe.

Pepe:
Nema, always a pleasure. I turned Russia upside down to be here with you tonight. It’s 11 p.m. in Moscow—I just arrived from St. Petersburg to be here on time so we could do this in a relaxed way, at least a little bit.

Nema:
Let’s get started, Pepe, with what’s going on in the Middle East. As time goes by, the situation is getting more dangerous and more fragile. It seems that the United States is escalating—moving fighter jets and bombers close to Iran. They're preparing for an attack. Even CNN has reported this idea of a two-week window. Somehow it feels like a game of deception—meant, of course, to keep Tehran confused. What’s your take on what’s going on?

Pepe:
Can I make an introduction before I answer your question?

Nema:
Go ahead.

Pepe:
Because we need to talk about St. Petersburg. It was the most important forum in Russia this year. I heard from Global South businessmen that, for them, it’s now more important than Davos. Why? Because they’re actually doing business.

This morning, the organizers in St. Petersburg announced—though it’s not the final count—that over $80 billion in deals were signed. That’s enormous by any standard. And the great thing is, these are Global South deals. This isn’t the international banking system. This isn’t BlackRock or the usual suspects. These are deals involving African nations. India and Pakistan were there. Pakistan even sent ministers. The Gulf Cooperation Council was present—Bahrain was one of the guests of honor. Southeast Asia was heavily represented. And of course, scores of African nations.

Naturally, Central Asia, Russia, and China were there too. Just to give you an idea, there was a Russia–China business panel on Wednesday. It was completely packed—people were standing outside because they couldn’t get in. Businessmen from both sides, local governors from different Russian oblasts, all talking about investments. The Russian officials were saying, “Look, the Chinese are investing in this, this, this project.” Amazing stuff.

There was a fantastic panel on international financial reform, and our friend Paulo Batista was the star. Can you imagine? Paulo spoke online for less than 10 minutes and stole the show. The panel was about reforming the international financial system. The Chinese participants were, as always, very cautious: “We must take things one step at a time.” But Paulo cut through that and said what needed to be said: "We have to go for broke. Our window of opportunity is small, and the real reforms must begin now."

That aligns with what the Russians have been working toward since last year—before the BRICS summit in Kazan. As we know, the next summit is in Brazil, so things are slowing down a bit in the Brazilian way. But at least we have people like Paulo, one of the founders of the New Development Bank, who understands that structural reform is essential.

And that kind of discussion—honest, urgent, and practical—you can only have at a forum like this. We had our own panel too. I was on a panel about fake news, but it went far beyond that. We discussed information control, artificial intelligence, and how fake news is increasingly being generated by Big Tech itself.

There was a high-ranking executive from Sberbank—the top Russian bank—sharing astonishing figures on fake news, not just in Russia but globally. When you compare this to the latest revelations about Palantir, it's shocking. Palantir is now embedded within the U.S. federal government. That means a massive AI company—one of the top high-tech firms in the West—is now effectively dictating policy.

How serious is that? These are the people building AI models for the Israelis to use in targeting Palestinians. So yes, it’s getting worse by the minute.

Now, about countering fake news: some Russian colleagues have started an organization called the Global Fact-Checking Network (GFCN). You can find them online—they have their own website. Many people, including myself, have joined. The idea is to create a blueprint for checking fake news and to build momentum for this discussion to eventually reach the BRICS table.

It’s not going to happen in Rio in a few days, of course, but perhaps at the next BRICS summit in South Africa. And if BRICS takes this seriously, we could eventually see the emergence of a BRICS-net, or BRICS-tube—an independent, alternative media sphere. Because we can’t just keep relying on Big Tech platforms—we know where that road leads, especially with dangerous figures like Peter Thiel and Alex Karp (formerly of PayPal) now embedded in the U.S. government.

This forum is changing, Nema. It’s great. It used to be more generalistic, but this year it was full of extremely practical panels—people offering real solutions, from geoeconomics to the IT sphere.

And of course, over it all hangs the dark cloud you asked about: Iran, Israel, and the U.S.—and what the U.S. is going to do.

Everyone was waiting for the plenary session yesterday with President Putin. And for the first time, the Global South was represented on stage. We had China, Indonesia, Bahrain, and South Africa. How cool is that? A true sample of the Global South.

Putin sees Southeast Asia and Africa as two of the most critical development regions in the near future. During his address, he diplomatically addressed the situation with Iran.

First, the Russian position is clear: Iran has the absolute, inalienable right to maintain a civilian nuclear program—which is exactly what they have.

Second, Putin said he received personal assurances from both Trump and Netanyahu that they will not bomb the Bushehr plant. Why? Because there are over 200 ultra high-tech Russian technicians working there. You can imagine how that conversation went—Putin calling and saying, “Don’t touch Bushehr,” and both of them understanding the consequences if they did.

Third, and this is very important: there has been criticism, especially from Russian Atlanticists and across the Global North, that Russia is not doing enough to help Iran. Putin explicitly said that those spreading this narrative are "provocateurs"—a literal translation from Russian.

So yes, they are helping. But discreetly.

hi everybody Today is Saturday June 21st 2025 and our friend Pepe Escobar is back
with us Welcome back Pepe Nema Always a pleasure I turned uh Russia upside down
to be here with you tonight It's 11 in Moscow I just arrived from St
Petersburg to be here on time so we could do this relaxed you know at least
a little bit Let's let's get started Pepe with what's
going on in the Middle East The situation as time goes by is getting more dangerous more fragile
And it seems that the United States is doing everything just moving these
fighter jets bombers close to Iran They're preparing for an attack on Iran
Even CNN reported that this sort of idea of two weeks and there's somehow there
it's a game of deception Of course to keep Therron confused Your take on
what's going on U can I make an introduction IA before I answer your
question Go ahead Because we need to talk about St Petersburg Yeah Uh it was
the most important forum in Russia this year and I heard from global south
businessmen in St Petersburg that for them is much more important than Davos
Why Because they are doing business This morning uh the organizers in St
Petersburg they announced that uh okay this is not the final count over $80
billion dollar of deals were signed in St Petersburg that's enormous by any
standards and the great thing is these are global south deals this is not uh
international banking system this is not black rock you know the usual suspects
these are African nations uh India and Pakistan were there uh the Pakistanis
they sent ministers you know uh the Gulf cooperation council Bahin was one of the
guests of honor Southeast Asia Everybody from Southeast Asia was there and of course scores of African nations So and
obviously Central Asia Russia China There was so just to give you an idea there was uh in the middle of uh on
Wednesday there was uh Russia China business panel packed
totally packed people out of the room because they couldn't get into the room businessmen from both
sides local governors in Russia different oblasts and everybody uh
talking business and uh uh the local go Russian government saying look the
Chinese are investing in this this this this project amazing stuff you know uh
there was a wonderful panel which our friend Apollo Batista he he was the star
of the panel online can imagine Paulo talked online for less than 10 minutes
and told the show it was a panel uh about um a possible reform of the
international financial system and the Russians there was a there was a Chinese there
was one Chinese as they were too uh careful they you know ah we have to go
little by little one step at a time and all that and Paulo says the real thing no we have to go for broke and our
window of opportunity is is you know it's quite small and the the real
important reforms they have to start now which is what the Russians were saying
and working for last year before the brick summit in Kazan last year because
as we all know the summit is in Brazil this year everything is slowing down the
Brazilian way but at least we have people like Paulo one of the founders of
the MDB new development bank He knows that there's got to be a structural
reform of the NDP and all that And this is something that is practically not
discussed even in Russia and in China So you know these kinds of conversations
only in a forum like this you you can have it We had our own panel I I was on
a panel on fake news which went way uh beyond that because we were discussing
um control of information artificial intelligence and the fact that now fake
news is going to be digitally produced by big tech itself This is one of the
key themes Uh there was for instance a very high ranking executive of a spare
bank the number one Russian bank and he was giving figures about fake news not
only Russia but absolutely astonishing and of course when you compare to the
latest information about uh Palunteer in fact Palunteer now is inside embedded in
the US federal government So we have a huge AI company
okay let's say among the top high-tech companies in the west now dictating policy
How serious is that These people already do uh AI models for the Israelis to kill
Palestinians So you know it's getting worse by the minute And of course uh uh the uh these
Russians uh these Russian friends they started um an organization that the
merit of this organizations is enormous It's called Global Factchecking Network
uh GFCN You can find them online They have their own website Uh lots of uh people have
joined including myself and we are trying to maybe um set up a blueprint
about uh controlling fake news checking fake
news and get this conversation going to the point that it would land on the bricks table Of course it's not going to
be in Rio in a few days you know but the next brick summit next year in South
Africa and then if you have this discussed by the bricks there's a strong possibility that we can have
uh just an example uh the beginning of a bricks net or a bricks tube or a all
around bricks alternative media sphere because we cannot simply be subjected to
the big tech platforms because we know exactly where it's going with the former
PayPal mafia with this very very dangerous characters Peter T and Alex
Karp and the fact that they are now part of the US government it's even even more dangerous so the forum was this forum is
changing Nema it's great because used to be too generalistic until next year This
year there were lots of panels that were extremely practical and people discussing possible solutions Everything
from geoeconomics to the IT sphere and of course the overarching theme the dark
cloud over all of us is your question Iran Israel and US and what is US going
to do Um the everybody was waiting for the plenary session which was yesterday
right with President Putin But first great thing about the plenary session the
global south was represented on stage at the plenary session we had China
Indonesia Bahrain and South Africa How cool is that This is a a sample of the global
south uh with the the guest of honor the president of Indonesia prao Southeast Asia which puts Putin sees as one of the
two top areas of development in the near future Southeast Asia and Africa and of
course Putin indirectly uh very diplomatically he
answered these questions about Iran Uh it's very clear in the Russian position
Iran has absolute inaliable rights to have a civilian nuclear program which is
what they have at the moment Number one Number two Putin said that he received
personal assurances from Trump and from Netanyahu that they are not going to
bomb Busher plant because there are over 200 ultra high tech Russian technicians
working at Busher So obviously we we can imagine the conversation right
putting on the phone say don't touch Busher and the other two like this because they know the consequences if
that happens Number three extremely important
There's a lot of criticism um partially in Russia from let's say the Russian
Atlanticist gang but mostly AC across the global north that Russia
is not doing enough to um help Iran Putin said explicitly these people who
are pedling this notion they are provocators provocati
literal translation from from Russian So this means we can infer that of course
they are helping discreetly
