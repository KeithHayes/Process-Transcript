Consider changes so output better matches input.

Desired output is cleaned into a word file containing 
words, words with special characters, and spaces as the only whitespace.

This becomes test input since it can be compared to output.

The LLM must not change the words or word order as it finds sentences in the input string of words.  This is priority.

A first pass identifies sentences and another pass punctuates them.  This seems like it could be simplified but it must not be.
The two pass structure must be maintained because it lets regular expressions properly connect sentences in the output as 
a side effect of removing the last punctuation mark in the new format and then allowing it be added in with the next chunk 
load and format.

Config.py must be set up to help keep the literal words and word order the same in the output relative to the input.





=== DOCS algorithm.txt ===
Consider a 1000 word document.

Always add a terminating space when appending a word to the output.

As words define chunk size, all file operations will read and write entire words. This will require class methods to accomplish file operations, and these methods must handle the end of the input file correctly to ensure proper completion.

Specifically, when reading words from the input file, if the requested number of words extends beyond the end of the file, the read 
operation should return only the remaining words available until the end of the file. If no words are available, it should 
return an empty set of words. Similarly, when writing words to the output file, the operation should only write the words actually 
provided, irrespective of any pre-calculated chunk sizes that might exceed the available words. This robust handling of file boundaries 
will ensure that the algorithm processes the entire input document accurately and completes without errors, even when dealing with 
the last chunks that may be smaller than the defined chunk size.

format is a function

alice warren sat beside a wide
window in the corner of her study the
late afternoon light slanted gently
across the hardwood floor illuminating
endless rows of books that lined the
walls she loved the hush of quiet
contemplation the soft rustle of
turning pages and the subtle comfort
of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she
found solace after a long day of
meetings presentations and endless
email chains the silence was not
merely an absence of noise it was a
presence in itself a companion that
whispered in comfortable tones and
allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden lay in gentle
bloom roses of deep crimson and pale
pink nodded in the early breeze while
lavender and thyme filled the
afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hopped atop the low
stone wall pecking at small insects
among the wild clover occasionally a
butterfly orange with black veined
wings fluttered past the aging glass
and alice followed its slow drifting
flight for a moment before returning
to her book such ordinary spectacles
when observed with attention held a
profound beauty it was a lesson she
had learned early and often that the
marvels of life are seldom grand or
flashy they are small quiet and
easily overlooked her book an anthology of 
short stories from the early twentieth 
century lay open on her lap the paper 
was slightly yellowed but sturdy the 
ink crisp each story contained within 
had been selected for its faithful
representation of time place and
character there was a certain charm
in the way authors of that era wove
descriptive passages around otherwise
trivial actions tying shoelaces
pouring tea gazing out toward a
stormy horizon such attentiveness to
detail formed a tapestry of everyday
life and it fascinated alice how these
small gestures could reveal so much
about an individuals hopes fears and
inner world
in one story a young woman stood at the
edge of a river watching the current
drift by as though it carried with it
unspoken promises of a distant future
the description was simple she lifted
her hands above her head letting the
cool early spring wind play through
her fingers yet that image carried
emotion enough to fill a lifetime of
longing alice closed her eyes

a moment she felt transported away
from her study to that riverside scene

chamomile infusion with just a hint
of honey alice poured the steaming
liquid into her favorite cup the one

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study.
The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.
The silence was not merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself, a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.
Outside, the garden lay in gentle bloom. Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness.
A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects among the wild clover.
Occasionally, a butterfly orange with black veined wings fluttered past the aging glass, and Alice followed its slow, drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book.
Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty.
It was a lesson she had learned, early and often: that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy; they are small, quiet, and easily overlooked.
Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap.
The paper was slightly yellowed, but sturdy; the ink, crisp. Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time, place, and character.
There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon.
Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life, and it fascinated Alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual’s hopes, fears, and inner world.
In one story, a young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future. The description was simple: “She lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool, early spring wind play through her fingers.” Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing.
Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, and for a moment, she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene.
Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window.
The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold.
Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool.
She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her.
It held a fragrant chamomile infusion, with just a hint of honey.
Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup, the one painted with delicate blue forget‑me‑nots.
She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind. It had become something of a ritual, this tea drinking ritual, a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.
Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story.
This one described an early morning in a busy city: horse drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones, merchants hawking wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues.
As she read, Alice imagined herself there: she could almost hear the clip clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot, the weight of her satchel on her shoulder.
Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality.
Such was the power of fine writing it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.
By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely.
The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair.
Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth.
In the distance, a lone streetlamp flickered to life; its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs.
Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.
She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being.
It was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition.
The end of daylight and arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection.
She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine: preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.
When she finally stood, the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room, Alice felt a gentle contentment.
Gratitude, even.
For the stories, yes and for the world beyond them, for the tactile, living reality she inhabits.
And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks: for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment.

Alice
Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study.
The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation; the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.
The silence wasn't just an absence of noise; it was a presence too—a companion that whispered in familiar tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.
Outside the garden lay in gentle bloom.
Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness.
A pair of Robbins hops onto the Low Stone Wall, Pecking at Small Insects amidst Wild Clover.
Occasionally, an Orange-and-Black Winged Butterfly Flits Past The Aged Glass; Alice Watches Slowly Drift Away With Interest Before Resuming Reading Her Book Upon Her Lap
This anthology contains tales from early twentieth century; each is meticulously chosen for its accurate portrayal through vivid descriptions that weave together seemingly insignificant moments into captivating narratives - like tying shoelaces becoming pause-filled with contemplative thoughts, or sipping tea signaling deep reflections upon life's own journey.
These intricate details paint pictures richer than any grand gesture ever could; unveiling characters' hidden depths while also reflecting broader societal trends during those times.
It is this appreciation toward minutiae that has always drawn me in.
Alice found herself drawn closer towards literature, seeking solace amidst its pages that so beautifully documented the ordinary lives and extraordinary experiences of others.
A young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future.
The description was simple, yet it held emotions enough to fill a lifetime of longing.
Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, feeling herself being transported away from her studies...to that river's side scene.
With a deep breath, she set the bookmark between the pages and looked up toward the window.
Outside, the Sun had sunk low into the Horizon; painting the Sky in an Array of Ethereal Shades—Lavender's and Gold's—blending Seamlessly Together until Everything seemed almost Surreal.
In no time at all, nightfall would descend upon them like a cloak draped over sleepy shoulders. Soon afterward, darkness would envelop even this tranquil corner of suburbia; it would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool.
She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her.
It held a fragrant chamomile infusion with just a hint of honey.
Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup—the one painted with delicate blue forget-me-nots.
Pausing to inhale the warm steam, she allowed its gentle scent to settle her mind.
It had become something of a ritual—this tea-drinking ritual; a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.
Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story.
This one described an early morning in a busy city; horsedrawn carriages rattled over cobblestone streets, merchants hawked wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices filled the air - in unfamiliar tongues. She read.
Alice imagined herself there; she could almost hear the clip-clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot.
The weight of her satchel hung heavily on her shoulder.
Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her sensitive senses.
Until she couldn't tell if what she felt were hers alone anymore...
Fine writing has always had the ability to transport readers into another world; its power is undeniable. The way certain phrases can be crafted creates an image so realistic you feel like you're part of the story yourself - almost as though there were no boundaries between reality and fiction anymore...
When at last I finished reading through both stories...
Darkness fell upon everything outside like a heavy curtain drawn shut for good measure against any remaining daylight left hanging precipitately beyond its edge. Inside, however, was still lit up bright enough—thanks largely due solely to one small desk lamp standing sentinel over near the corner that cast out just barely a sufficient amount of warm, yellow-tinged white artificial illumination necessary—allowing a young girl to continue her relentless pursuit through countless pages filled with printed matter adorned in solid blocks of deepest ebony characters set off by pristine sheets of crystallized chalkiness.
Right up until that moment arrives when she looks back again towards the clock ticking steadily away relentlessly marking the passage of time's seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years; never stopping nor slowing down regardless of how slowly at times progress may have been made thus far along what seems like an eternal stretch of roadway flanked only by darkness - save for those rare occasions upon which some distant lonesome streetlights would flicker briefly alive emitting feeble bursts of dimmed-orange hue reflecting dully yet somehow magically transforming nearby foliage into ethereal luminescent spheres resembling precious jewels glinting softly amidst velvetty nighttime gloominess enveloping everything around within its cloak concealing secret untold mysteries waiting patiently whispering promises hinting possibilities offering hope unto inspired dreamers such as our fair protagonist hereinbefore described.
She had just finished reading through another captivating chapter from her beloved book collection, which lay beside one another on the bedside table, glowing with promise beneath the faint light cast by an old-fashioned lamppost.
With great care and affection, she placed this latest addition next to the others, watching fondly as they seemed almost alive with anticipation—for what adventures might lie ahead? She would reread them one day in some distant future; until then, there was nothing left but her imagination.
Closing her eyes, she put down the book that had been keeping her company for so long - filled with stories from across different genres like History, Fantasy, Romance, Tragedy, Triumph, Joy, Sorrow, Laughter, Tears... Each page holding within them tales of hope and despair; love lost and found again; heroism amidst adversity; adventures beyond imagination; journeys towards self-discovery; battles fought bravely despite all odds stacked up against them... It was hard not feel inspired by such narratives which seemed almost limitless in scope yet deeply personal too – touching upon universal human emotions while also offering unique perspectives on life's myriad experiences... And now here she sat contemplating what lessons might have rubbed off onto herself during this extended literary journey? What insights gained would shape who she became next? Only time will tell but one thing remained certain – there were still countless more worlds left unexplored between those covers waiting patiently until another curious mind dared venture forth once more into their enchanting realms…
