=== DOCS algorithm.txt ===
Consider a 1000 word document.

Always add a terminating space when appending a word to the output.

As words define chunk size, all file operations will read and write entire words. This will require class methods to accomplish file operations, and these methods must handle the end of the input file correctly to ensure proper completion.

Specifically, when reading words from the input file, if the requested number of words extends beyond the end of the file, the read 
operation should return only the remaining words available until the end of the file. If no words are available, it should 
return an empty set of words. Similarly, when writing words to the output file, the operation should only write the words actually 
provided, irrespective of any pre-calculated chunk sizes that might exceed the available words. This robust handling of file boundaries 
will ensure that the algorithm processes the entire input document accurately and completes without errors, even when dealing with 
the last chunks that may be smaller than the defined chunk size.

alice warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study the late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itself a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered outside the garden lay in gentle bloom roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness a pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects among the wild clover occasionally a butterfly orange with black veined wings fluttered past the aging glass and alice followed its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book such ordinary spectacles when observed with attention held a profound beauty it was a lesson she had learned early and often that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy they are small quiet and easily overlooked her book an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century lay open on her lap the paper was slightly yellowed but sturdy the ink crisp each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time place and character there was a certain charm in the way authors of that era

alice
warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study
the lateafternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls
she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains
the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itselfa companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden laid in gentle bloom
roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects among the wild clover
occasionally a butterflyorange with black veined wingsfluttered past the aging glass alice followed its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book
such ordinary spectacles when observed with attention held a profound beauty
it was a lesson she had learned early and often the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy
had been selected for its faithful representation of time place and character
there was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actionstying shoelaces pouring tea gazing out toward a stormy horizon
such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life and it fascinated
alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individuals hopes fears and inner world in one story
a young woman stood at the edge of a river watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future
the description was simple
she lifted her hands above her head letting the cool earlyspring wind played through her fingers yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing
alice closed her eyes imagining the wind on her skin and for a moment she felt transported away from her study to that rivers side scene
then she opened her eyes again setting the bookmark between the pages and raised her gaze to the window
the sun had sunk lower the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold
soon the garden would blur into silhouettes and the air would cool
she reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her
it held a fragrant chamomile infusion with just a hint of honey
alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cupthe one painted with delicate blue forgetmenots
pausing to inhale the warm steam allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind it had become something of a ritualthis teadrinking ritual a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest
turning back to her anthology she selected a different story this one describing an enchanted forest where fairies danced beneath the moonlight
early morning in a busy city horsedrawn carriages rattled over cobblestone streets merchants hawked wares at street stalls and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues filled the air
as she read
alice imagined herself there she could almost hear the clipclop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot

and for the silence that followed
she was grateful for the world beyond them for the tactile living reality she inhabited and so at the close of day she gave thanksfor words for solitude and for the small wonders that attended each ordinary moment
