Consider changes so output better matches input.

Desired output is cleaned into a word file containing 
words, words with special characters, and spaces as the only whitespace.

This becomes test input since it can be compared to output.

The LLM must not change the words or word order as it finds sentences in the input string of words.  This is priority.

A first pass identifies sentences and another pass punctuates them.  This seems like it could be simplified but it must not be.

The two pass structure must be maintained because it lets regular expressions properly connect sentences in the output as 
a side effect of removing the last punctuation mark in the new format and then allowing it be added in with the next chunk 
loaded and formated.

framents of sentences should be collected on a line if they follow each other or they should be on the line by itself




=== DOCS algorithm.txt ===
Consider a 1000 word document.

Always add a terminating space when appending a word to the output.

As words define chunk size, all file operations will read and write entire words. This will require class methods to accomplish file operations, and these methods must handle the end of the input file correctly to ensure proper completion.

Specifically, when reading words from the input file, if the requested number of words extends beyond the end of the file, the read 
operation should return only the remaining words available until the end of the file. If no words are available, it should 
return an empty set of words. Similarly, when writing words to the output file, the operation should only write the words actually 
provided, irrespective of any pre-calculated chunk sizes that might exceed the available words. This robust handling of file boundaries 
will ensure that the algorithm processes the entire input document accurately and completes without errors, even when dealing with 
the last chunks that may be smaller than the defined chunk size.

format is a function

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study.
The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.
The silence was not merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself, a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.
Outside, the garden lay in gentle bloom. Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness.
A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects among the wild clover.
Occasionally, a butterfly orange with black veined wings fluttered past the aging glass, and Alice followed its slow, drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book.
Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty.
It was a lesson she had learned, early and often: that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy; they are small, quiet, and easily overlooked.
Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap.
The paper was slightly yellowed, but sturdy; the ink, crisp. Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time, place, and character.
There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon.
Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life, and it fascinated Alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual’s hopes, fears, and inner world.
In one story, a young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future. The description was simple: “She lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool, early spring wind play through her fingers.” Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing.
Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, and for a moment, she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene.
Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window.
The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold.
Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool.
She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her.
It held a fragrant chamomile infusion, with just a hint of honey.
Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup, the one painted with delicate blue forget‑me‑nots.
She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind. It had become something of a ritual, this tea drinking ritual, a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.
Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story.
This one described an early morning in a busy city: horse drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones, merchants hawking wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues.
As she read, Alice imagined herself there: she could almost hear the clip clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot, the weight of her satchel on her shoulder.
Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality.
Such was the power of fine writing it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.
By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely.
The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair.
Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth.
In the distance, a lone streetlamp flickered to life; its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs.
Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.
She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being.
It was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition.
The end of daylight and arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection.
She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine: preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.
When she finally stood, the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room, Alice felt a gentle contentment.
Gratitude, even.
For the stories, yes and for the world beyond them, for the tactile, living reality she inhabits.
And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks: for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment.

until she couldnt tell if they were hers or part of the tale being woven by the author
fine writing possessed such power creating an illusion so realistic the boundary separating reader and protagonist became indiscernible
as night fell completing the second chapter left her surrounded in near total darkness
only the warm glow emanated from the desk lamp provided any respite
its gentle radiance casting shadows crossed the room while highlighting the comforts within arms reach her trusty pen wellworn bookmark and steaming cup of tea were now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth
in the distance a lone street lamp flickered to life its orange glow reflected onto dewy leaves transforming them into luminescent orbs
with a gentle sigh
alice closed the anthology pressing a lovingly wrinkled finger against the spine before carefully placing it back on the shelf beside her bedside table
sitting there for another quiet minute with her teacup still clutched tightly between both hands she savoring these simple moments which marked not just an ending but also signalized new beginnings transitions from one state of consciousness to another

realitys demands she rose gracefully from where she had been sitting all alone amidst soft whispers of
