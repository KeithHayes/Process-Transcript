The task

async def formatchunk(self, chunktext: str) -> str:


Is to be rewritten.  The LoRA created from the training data will be used to format the input.  

The command is taken from the training data.

Training data is : /home/kdog/pythonprojects/process_transcript/training/datasets/augmented_dataset.jsonl

Checkpoints generated by axolotal using : /home/kdog/pythonprojects/process_transcript/training/datasets/config,yaml

is at : /home/kdog/text-generation-webui/training/trained_checkpoints/tinyllama_punctuation

The text-generation-webui should be started with the LoRA if it is not yet started.  
A separate function should start the llm and load the LoRA as needed.

            Your task is to reformat the provided text.
            Strictly adhere to the following rules:
            - Maintain the EXACT original words and their order.
            - NEVER add, delete, rephrase, or summarize any words.
            - Put each complete sentence on its own line.
            - Do NOT merge sentences together.
            - Do NOT let proper names end sentences if they are part of an ongoing thought.
            - Add proper punctuation (periods, question marks, exclamation points) to complete sentences only at their end.
            - Capitalize the first word of each complete sentence.
            - Leave incomplete fragments as-is on their own line.
            - ONLY output the reformatted text. DO NOT include any additional commentary, explanations, or instructions.
            - Ensure there are no extra spaces before or after any punctuation mark.

            Example:
            Input: "the cat sat the dog ran"
