Consider changes so output better matches input.

Desired output is cleaned into a word file containing 
words, words with special characters, and spaces as the only whitespace.

This becomes test input since it can be compared to output.

The LLM must not change the words or word order as it finds sentences in the input string of words.  This is priority.

A first pass identifies sentences and another pass punctuates them.  This seems like it could be simplified but it must not be.
The two pass structure must be maintained because it lets regular expressions properly connect sentences in the output as 
a side effect of removing the last punctuation mark in the new format and then allowing it be added in with the next chunk 
load and format.

Config.py must be set up to help keep the literal words and word order the same in the output relative to the input.





=== DOCS algorithm.txt ===
Consider a 1000 word document.

Always add a terminating space when appending a word to the output.

As words define chunk size, all file operations will read and write entire words. This will require class methods to accomplish file operations, and these methods must handle the end of the input file correctly to ensure proper completion.

Specifically, when reading words from the input file, if the requested number of words extends beyond the end of the file, the read 
operation should return only the remaining words available until the end of the file. If no words are available, it should 
return an empty set of words. Similarly, when writing words to the output file, the operation should only write the words actually 
provided, irrespective of any pre-calculated chunk sizes that might exceed the available words. This robust handling of file boundaries 
will ensure that the algorithm processes the entire input document accurately and completes without errors, even when dealing with 
the last chunks that may be smaller than the defined chunk size.

format is a function

with 150 words from the input file from pointer1

pointer1 = 550

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study.
The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.
The silence was not merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself, a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.
Outside, the garden lay in gentle bloom. Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness.
A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects among the wild clover.
Occasionally, a butterfly orange with black veined wings fluttered past the aging glass, and Alice followed its slow, drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book.
Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty.
It was a lesson she had learned, early and often: that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy; they are small, quiet, and easily overlooked.
Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap.
The paper was slightly yellowed, but sturdy; the ink, crisp. Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time, place, and character.
There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon.
Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life, and it fascinated Alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual’s hopes, fears, and inner world.
In one story, a young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future. The description was simple: “She lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool, early spring wind play through her fingers.” Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing.
Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, and for a moment, she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene.
Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window.
The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold.
Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool.
She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her.
It held a fragrant chamomile infusion, with just a hint of honey.
Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup, the one painted with delicate blue forget‑me‑nots.
She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind. It had become something of a ritual, this tea drinking ritual, a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.
Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story.
This one described an early morning in a busy city: horse drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones, merchants hawking wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues.
As she read, Alice imagined herself there: she could almost hear the clip clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot, the weight of her satchel on her shoulder.
Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality.
Such was the power of fine writing it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.
By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely.
The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair.
Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth.
In the distance, a lone streetlamp flickered to life; its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs.
Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.
She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being.
It was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition.
The end of daylight and arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection.
She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine: preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.
When she finally stood, the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room, Alice felt a gentle contentment.
Gratitude, even.
For the stories, yes and for the world beyond them, for the tactile, living reality she inhabits.
And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks: for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment.

Alice
Warren sat besides a wide window in the corner of her study.
The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation; the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.
The silence wasn't just an absence of noise; it was a presence too—a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.
Outside the garden lay in gentle bloom; roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze. Lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with its fragrant sweetness.
A pair of Robbins hopped atop the Low Stone Wall Pecking At Small Insects Amongst The Wild Clover!
Occasionally, an orange-and-black winged butterfly would flit past the old glass windowpane in my grandmother's house.
Alice would follow its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book.
Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty; it was a lesson she had learned early and often—that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy but rather small, quiet, and easily overlooked. Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap.
The paper was slightly yellowed but sturdy; the ink crisp.
Each Story Contained Within Had Been Selected For Its Faithful Representation Of Time Place And Character.
There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial events—actions like tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon.
Such attention to detail forms a tapestry of daily living; it's quite fascinating!
Alice found that even the smallest actions can reflect someone's deepest desires, anxieties, and hidden thoughts - truly remarkable insights into another person's psyche!
In One Story A Young Woman Stood At The Edge Of A River Watching The Current Drift By As If It Carried With It Unspoken Promises Of A Distant Future.
The description was simple; she lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool evening breeze play through her fingers.
Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill pages upon pages—a lifetime of longing.
Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin. For a moment, she felt transported away from her studies to that river's side scene.
Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages. Raising her gaze to the window, the sun had sunk low; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold.
Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool down.
Reaching for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her, she poured herself a cup of its fragrant Chamomile Infusion—with just a hint of Honey—into her favorite cup, the one painted with Delicate Blue Forget-me-nots.
With that, it became something of a ritual—this tea-drinking ritual; a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.
Turning back to her anthology, she selected another story— this one describing an early morning in a bustling city where horse-drawn carriages were rattling over cobblestone streets while merchants hawked their wares from street stalls. The clamor of voices speaking in unfamiliar tongues filled the air.
As She Read Aloud
Alice could imagine herself there amidst it all—she could even hear the clip-clop of hooves and feel the rough stone beneath her feet!
The weight of her satchel resting on her shoulder made everything seem more realistic!
She closed her eyes again to let the sounds and textures surround her senses entirely before opening them back up into reality.
Fine writing possesses such powerful imagery that it often feels like one's very existence becomes intertwined with its pages. When at last night falls, it casts shadows across every corner of the room; leaving just enough light filtering through the windows for comfortable reading alone. By then, the end of Chapter Two lies ahead, waiting patiently on her bedside table beside sleepy-head readers who snuggle deep inside warm blankets while dreaming sweet dreams off faraway places full of wondrous adventure await discovery tomorrow’s sunrise brings another day closer to exploring unknown territories shadow realms defined only by glimpses single landing moths take flight into luminous orb second hand Alice closed anthology slipped finger against spin guides book top place left turn to them into lukewarm rebounded red globe reflected dewy leaf leave turning this moment before rising en route beginning next phase evenings routines involve preparing light suppers write few thoughtful entries journals maybe step outside back porches breath beneath skies starry
When she finally stood the teacup empty, the anthology was closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room.
Alice felt a gentle contentment...even
For the stories... yes! And for the world beyond them; for the tactile, living reality she inhabited.
At the close of day, she gave thanks for words - for solitude and for the small wonders that attended each moment. Ordinary moments can be extraordinary if you take time to appreciate them.
