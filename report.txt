Current status:   

Output is generated, but the program algorithm has not been clearly defined until now.  Therefore the project must be examined and 
compared to the following logic and corrected as needed.

Purpose.  To identify sentences and punctuate and correct them when they are found.  Leaving other text unchanged.


Algorithm design :

Considering the previous chunk if any as possibly providing the start of a sentence in the new chunk, identify all complete sentences in the chunk. 
If a complete sentence is identified the spelling and punctuation is corrected for that sentence.  Sentences start with a capital letter and end 
with a period or question mark.  Sentences have commas, connecting dashes will not be used.  Text that is not is in a sentence will be unchanged. 
Linefeeds are removed and a space is optionally added to enforce word boundries.

When a new chunk is added it overlaps the previous chunk, allowing the overlapped part to be rewritten subject to new chunk information 
such as the new chunk completeing tthe sentence.

The purpose of the LLM is to identify sentences in a raw audio transcript and gramatically correct them.

Connecting dashes must be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and 
the capital letter of a new sentence as appropriate.

The document is split into multiple chunks with overlap to accomplish the sentence detections across chunk boundaries.

Chunking is along word boundaries.   

Chumking overlap allows corrections on the tail end of formatted output to accomidate information as the new chunk overlap 
replaces the end of the previous chunk as the new chunk is appended to the output.

Example:  If a chunk is 1000 characters long the second chunnk would begin at 800 characters so the 
first 200 characters are copied and possibly reformatted the previous chunk.  

This overlap allows a sentence to be found across a chunk boundry.

The end of the second chunk is at 1800 so the third chunk begins at 1600 to repeat the overlap re-write correction process allowing 
all complete sentences to be identified and gramatically corrected.

This should be a common technique to process a 'translation' in chunks.  The web should be consulted as needed to ensure logic is correct.

Text outside of sentences is unchanged except that line breaks are removed.

A single blank line will divide chunks as they are added to the output file.  These blank lines are invisible to the algorithm and formatting 
process as they are added post processing only to the output file.  



The formatted output is not like the desired output which preserves the original words in order.  The task is only to identify sentences.  
The task is not to rewrite them.  The task is to find and punctuate pre-existing sentences.



The task.  

Complete evaluation of the existing code must be done to see what part of the desired algortithm has been implemented and to 
determine what must be corrected.

Complete python files will be returned no snippets.

Current output in 'formatted_transcript.txt' does not match 'desired_output.txt'.  Correction is required.  Verify the tail of the 
output is rewritten correctly and that the complete input 'transcript.txt' is processed.

In her peaceful study, Alice Warren enjoyed sitting by the large windows as the gentle afternoon sunlight streamed through, casting warm shadows on the wooden floors. The room was surrounded by countless bookshelves full of beloved novels; their stories providing solace amidst daily chaos. It was here where she sought refuge after busy days filled with work obligations such as meetings and emails. The tranquil ambiance offered more than just silence - it provided companionship for thoughtful reflection without interruption or distraction from external noises. Just beyond her window laid a serene garden teeming with life - vibrant red roses swaying in the slightest breeze alongside. The tranquil atmosphere offered more than mere silence; it provided solace for introspective contemplation without disruption or diversion from exterior sounds. A peaceful garden lay beyond Alice's window, brimming with life – vivid red roses swayed gently in the soft breeze amidst lush greenery dotted with buzzing insects like bees and tiny flies flitting about their business unbothered by Alice's presence. Occasionally, even a colorful butterfly would make an appearance – once, one as bright orange as a sunset adorned with delicate black veins passed leisurely through the aged glass pane catching Alice'. As dusk approached, Alice found herself engrossed in a novel set against a backdrop of rural England. Occasionally, even a colorful butterfly would make an appearance - once, one as bright orange as a sunset adorned with delicate black veins passed leisurely through the aged glass pane catching Alice's attention towards a stormy horizon. The author's simple descriptions formed a tapestry of everyday life; they were filled with emotions that revealed much about characters' hopes, fears, and inner worlds within each storyline. In one particular passage, there was a young woman standing at the edge of a river, feeling its currents carry unsp. At dusk by the river's edge stood Alice, feeling its calming currents flow around her feet. As daylight faded and stars began twinkling overhead, the once vibrant colors of nature transformed into soft shades of purple and gold. The lush garden behind her gradually blended into darkness, creating eerie yet mesmerizing silhouettes against the night sky. She took a deep breath, savoring the cool breeze that carried hints of floral perfumes from nearby gardens. Almost hear the clip clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot the weight of her satchel on her shoulder again she closed her eyes letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality such was the power of fine writing it created an illusion so vivid so grounded that the line between reader and narrator blurred by the time she finished the second story darkness had fallen completely the study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair beyond the window the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth in the distance a lone streetlamp flickered to life its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves turning them into luminous orbs alice closed the anthology pressed a finger against the spine and slid the book into its place on the shelf she sat for a moment longer teacup in hand simply being it was a practice in mindfulness in appreciating transition the end. After closing the book on the anthology and feeling grateful for the tales within, Alice heard the night settle around her as darkness fell. The sound of horses' hooves and rough stones beneath their feet transported her imagination once more; yet here in her cozy study, surrounded by familiar things, she remained firmly planted amidst the pages of literature. Finishing up her tea, Alice knew it was time to tend to other tasks - journaling, dinner prep, maybe some starry-sky contemplation on the back porch. As dusk deepened, peace filled every corner of this tranquil writer's haven where words truly came alive.

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study. The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls. She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink. It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains. The silence was not merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself, a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.

Outside, the garden lay in gentle bloom. Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness. A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects among the wild clover. Occasionally, a butterfly—orange with black-veined wings—fluttered past the aging glass, and Alice followed its slow, drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book. Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty. It was a lesson she had learned, early and often: that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy; they are small, quiet, and easily overlooked.

Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap. The paper was slightly yellowed, but sturdy; the ink, crisp. Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time, place, and character. There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions—tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon. Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life, and it fascinated Alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual’s hopes, fears, and inner world.

In one story, a young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future. The description was simple: “She lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool, early-spring wind play through her fingers.” Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing. Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, and for a moment, she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene. Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window.

The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold. Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool. She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her. It held a fragrant chamomile infusion, with just a hint of honey. Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup, the one painted with delicate blue forget‑me‑nots. She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind. It had become something of a ritual, this tea-drinking ritual, a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.

Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story. This one described an early morning in a busy city: horse-drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones, merchants hawking wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues. As she read, Alice imagined herself there: she could almost hear the clip-clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot, the weight of her satchel on her shoulder. Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality. Such was the power of fine writing—it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.

By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely. The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair. Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth. In the distance, a lone streetlamp flickered to life; its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs. Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.

She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being. It was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition. The end of daylight and arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection. She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine: preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.

When she finally stood, the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room, Alice felt a gentle contentment. Gratitude, even. For the stories, yes—and for the world beyond them, for the tactile, living reality she inhabits. And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks: for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment.
