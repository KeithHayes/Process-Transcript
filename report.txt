Consider changes so output better matches input.

Desired output is cleaned into a word file containing 
words, words with special characters, and spaces as the only whitespace.

This becomes test input since it can be compared to output.

The LLM must not change the words or word order as it finds sentences in the input string of words.  This is priority.

A first pass identifies sentences and another pass punctuates them.  This seems like it could be simplified but it must not be.

The two pass structure must be maintained because it lets regular expressions properly connect sentences in the output as 
a side effect of removing the last punctuation mark in the new format and then allowing it be added in with the next chunk 
loaded and formated.

framents of sentences should be collected on a line if they follow each other or they should be on the line by itself




=== DOCS algorithm.txt ===
Consider a 1000 word document.

Always add a terminating space when appending a word to the output.

As words define chunk size, all file operations will read and write entire words. This will require class methods to accomplish file operations, and these methods must handle the end of the input file correctly to ensure proper completion.

Specifically, when reading words from the input file, if the requested number of words extends beyond the end of the file, the read 
operation should return only the remaining words available until the end of the file. If no words are available, it should 
return an empty set of words. Similarly, when writing words to the output file, the operation should only write the words actually 
provided, irrespective of any pre-calculated chunk sizes that might exceed the available words. This robust handling of file boundaries 
will ensure that the algorithm processes the entire input document accurately and completes without errors, even when dealing with 
the last chunks that may be smaller than the defined chunk size.

format is a function

format chunk1 

copy the first 150 words in chunk1 to the output file

copy the remaining 100 words in chunk1 into the beginning of chunk 2, and fill the rest of chunk 2 
with 150 words from the input file from pointer1

copy the remaining 100 words in chunk3 into the beginning of chunk 4, and fill the rest of chunk 4 
with 150 words from the input file from pointer1

pointer1 = 700

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study.
The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.
The silence was not merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself, a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.
Outside, the garden lay in gentle bloom. Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness.
A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects among the wild clover.
Occasionally, a butterfly orange with black veined wings fluttered past the aging glass, and Alice followed its slow, drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book.
Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty.
It was a lesson she had learned, early and often: that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy; they are small, quiet, and easily overlooked.
Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap.
The paper was slightly yellowed, but sturdy; the ink, crisp. Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time, place, and character.
There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon.
Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life, and it fascinated Alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual’s hopes, fears, and inner world.
In one story, a young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future. The description was simple: “She lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool, early spring wind play through her fingers.” Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing.
Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, and for a moment, she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene.
Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window.
The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold.
Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool.
She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her.
It held a fragrant chamomile infusion, with just a hint of honey.
Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup, the one painted with delicate blue forget‑me‑nots.
She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind. It had become something of a ritual, this tea drinking ritual, a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.
Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story.
This one described an early morning in a busy city: horse drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones, merchants hawking wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues.
As she read, Alice imagined herself there: she could almost hear the clip clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot, the weight of her satchel on her shoulder.
Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality.
Such was the power of fine writing it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.
By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely.
The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair.
Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth.
In the distance, a lone streetlamp flickered to life; its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs.
Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.
She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being.
It was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition.
The end of daylight and arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection.
She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine: preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.
When she finally stood, the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room, Alice felt a gentle contentment.
Gratitude, even.
For the stories, yes and for the world beyond them, for the tactile, living reality she inhabits.
And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks: for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment.

Warren sat besides a wide window in the corner of her study.
The late-afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls.
She loved the hush of quiet contemplation; the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink.
It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.
The silence wasn't just an absence of sound; it was its own entity—a comforting presence that gently nudged one's thoughts forward without interference.

Air is essential for life on Earth. It consists mostly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with small amounts of other gases like argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, methane, krypton, hydrogen, xenon, and trace elements such as ammonia, water vapor, and sulfur compounds. The atmosphere protects us from harmful radiation by absorbing some of its energy before reaching our planet's surface; however, human activities have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions which trap heat within this delicate envelope surrounding our world - leading to global warming issues that threaten not only current civilizations but also future generations who will inherit whatever state we leave behind.

Glass is an amorphous solid material that can be shaped by melting in a furnace and then cooling rapidly with water or air quenching techniques. It has unique optical properties due to its molecular structure which allows light transmission while distorting images seen through it.

The moment I saw her, my heart skipped a beat.
Before you begin your journey, make sure that you have everything ready.
Returning home after work, I found my wife in tears on the couch. She had just received news that her mother was diagnosed with cancer again. We held each other tightly while she cried uncontrollably into my shoulder. As we sat there comforting one another, all I could think about were our own struggles over the years - financial difficulties due to unexpected job loss; health scares for both me and our daughter; arguments leading nowhere but resentment building up between us... And yet through everything, here we still stood together facing this new challenge head-on – stronger than ever before because we've been through hell and back already side by side.
Bookshelves! I need more space for my books.
Once upon a time...
More is needed for this task.
Books can be found in libraries, bookstores, and online marketplaces like Amazon. They come in various genres such as fiction, non-fiction, romance, mystery, science fiction, fantasy, horror, self-help, biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, cookbooks, travel guides...

Grand is an adjective that means impressive in size or style. It can also refer to something related to one's family history or ancestry. For example, "The old mansion had a very grand entrance," or "She was proud of her French-Canadian grandparents."
Flashy! The car was so shiny that I couldn't help but stare in amazement. It had all the latest features and looked like something out of a science fiction movie. As we drove down the highway, people kept turning their heads to get another look at this incredible vehicle. Even though it cost more than my house, I knew it would be worth every penny for years to come.

Time is precious. We should never waste it on things that don't matter in life. Instead, we should spend our valuable hours doing what brings us joy and fulfillment. This could mean pursuing hobbies like painting or playing music, spending quality time with loved ones, volunteering for causes close to your heart, learning new skills such as coding or cooking - anything really! Remember not to let society dictate how you ought to be using your time; live authentically according to who YOU truly are and want to become.
Place your bets now! The race is about to start.
Character
Charm is an essential quality that can make someone more attractive and likable. It's not just about being physically appealing but also having a pleasant personality and demeanor. People with charisma tend to draw others towards them effortlessly because of their magnetic presence.

Otherwise
Trivial actions such as tying shoes, pouring tea, or gazing toward a stormy horizon are often overlooked in daily lives; however, they can provide insight into an individual's thoughts and emotions.
For example, in one tale, a young lady stands besides a flowing river, allowing herself to be touched by the breeze while watching the water pass by; perhaps hoping for something more from this seemingly ordinary moment - a lifetime of longing.
Alice thought, "Closing my eyes and imagining the wind on my skin..."
For a moment, she felt transported away from her studies...to that riverbank scene.
With a soft smile playing at her lips, she set the bookmark between the pages and looked up toward the window.
The Sun Had Already Started Its Descent; The Sky Was Painted In Ethereal Shades Of Lavender And Gold.
Very soon now, the garden outside will fade into silent silhouettes, while the evening breeze begins to chill the room.
Reaching out gently, she took hold of the tiny porcelain teapot sitting on the table beside her. It contained an invigorating cup of Chamomile tea, brewed perfectly with just a hint of honey's sweetness.
Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup—the one painted with delicate blue forget-me-nots.
She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind.
It had become something of a ritual - this tea drinking ritual; a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.
Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story.
This one described an early morning in a busy city; horsedrawn carriages rattled over cobblestone streets, merchants hawked wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues filled the air.
Alice found herself transported as she read.
She envisioned herself amidst the chaos of city life; hearing the rhythmic clop-clop of horse hooves on pavement filling her ears.
Feeling the rough stones beneath her feet while carrying her heavy satchel on one shoulder, she was reminded once again of the magic that lies within great literature.
As night fell upon her studies, casting shadows across pages filled by candlelight, not even darkness itself seemed capable of breaking this spell. For when at last she looked up, beyond the glow emanating from within arm's reach, out into lush gardens aglimmer against starry skies lay a shadowy realm—defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth.
In the distance, a lone streetlight flickered to life. Its orange glow reflected on dew-covered leaves, transforming them into shimmering spheres.
Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.
She sat for a moment longer, tea cup in hand, simply being...
This was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transitions.
The End Of Daylight And Arrival Of Evening Marked Not Just The Change Between Light And Dark But Also The Movement From Narrative To Reflection.
Allowing herself this small pause, she rose to begin the next phase of her evening routine—preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and maybe even stepping outside onto the back porch to breathe underneath a sky full of stars.
When she finally stood up with her empty teacup, the anthology had been closed for quite some time now; silence filled every corner of the room.
Alice felt a gentle contentment-gratitude, even though she knew there was still much work left to do.
For The Stories
Yes, but also for the world beyond them; for the tactile, living reality she inhabited.
And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks - For words, for solitude; 
And for the small wonders That attend Every Ordinary Moment.
