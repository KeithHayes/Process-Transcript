Current status:   

Output is generated, but the program algorithm has not been clearly defined until now.  Therefore the project must be examined and 
compared to the following logic and corrected as needed.

Purpose.  To identify sentences and punctuate and correct them when they are found.  Leaving other text unchanged.


Algorithm design :

Considering the previous chunk if any as possibly providing the start of a sentence in the new chunk, identify all complete sentences in the chunk. 
If a complete sentence is identified the spelling and punctuation is corrected for that sentence.  Sentences start with a capital letter and end 
with a period or question mark.  Sentences have commas, connecting dashes will not be used.  Text that is not is in a sentence will be unchanged. 
Linefeeds are removed and a space is optionally added to enforce word boundries.

When a new chunk is added it overlaps the previous chunk, allowing the overlapped part to be rewritten subject to new chunk information 
such as the new chunk completeing tthe sentence.

The purpose of the LLM is to identify sentences in a raw audio transcript and gramatically correct them.

Connecting dashes must be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and 
the capital letter of a new sentence as appropriate.

The document is split into multiple chunks with overlap to accomplish the sentence detections across chunk boundaries.

Chunking is along word boundaries.   

Chumking overlap allows corrections on the tail end of formatted output to accomidate information as the new chunk overlap 
replaces the end of the previous chunk as the new chunk is appended to the output.

Example:  If a chunk is 1000 characters long the second chunnk would begin at 800 characters so the 
first 200 characters are copied and possibly reformatted the previous chunk.  

This overlap allows a sentence to be found across a chunk boundry.

The end of the second chunk is at 1800 so the third chunk begins at 1600 to repeat the overlap re-write correction process allowing 
all complete sentences to be identified and gramatically corrected.

This should be a common technique to process a 'translation' in chunks.  The web should be consulted as needed to ensure logic is correct.

Text outside of sentences is unchanged except that line breaks are removed.

A single blank line will divide chunks as they are added to the output file.  These blank lines are invisible to the algorithm and formatting 
process as they are added post processing only to the output file.

The task.  

Complete evaluation of the existing code must be done to see what part of the desired algortithm has been implemented and to 
determine what must be corrected.

Complete files will be returned so python maintains correct indentation should there be any changes in python files.

Current output in 'formatted_transcript.txt' does not match 'desired_output.txt'.  Correction is required.

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study. The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls. She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink. It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains.

Speaker 1: The silence wasn't just an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself - a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered. Outside, the sun shone brightly on the garden path while birds chirped merrily from nearby trees. Alice sat upon an old wooden bench underneath the shade cast by a large oak tree. She watched as butterflies flitted about above her head. One particularly beautiful specimen caught her attention - its wings were bright orange with intricate patterns resembling veins made up of thin black lines. As she admired its beauty, it landed gracefully on top of

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study. The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls. She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink. It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains. The silence was not merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself, a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.

Outside, the garden lay in gentle bloom. Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness. A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects among the wild clover. Occasionally, a butterfly—orange with black-veined wings—fluttered past the aging glass, and Alice followed its slow, drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book. Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty. It was a lesson she had learned, early and often: that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy; they are small, quiet, and easily overlooked.

Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap. The paper was slightly yellowed, but sturdy; the ink, crisp. Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time, place, and character. There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions—tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon. Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life, and it fascinated Alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual’s hopes, fears, and inner world.

In one story, a young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future. The description was simple: “She lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool, early-spring wind play through her fingers.” Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing. Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, and for a moment, she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene. Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window.

The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold. Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool. She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her. It held a fragrant chamomile infusion, with just a hint of honey. Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup, the one painted with delicate blue forget‑me‑nots. She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind. It had become something of a ritual, this tea-drinking ritual, a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.

Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story. This one described an early morning in a busy city: horse-drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones, merchants hawking wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues. As she read, Alice imagined herself there: she could almost hear the clip-clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot, the weight of her satchel on her shoulder. Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality. Such was the power of fine writing—it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.

By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely. The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair. Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth. In the distance, a lone streetlamp flickered to life; its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs. Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.

She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being. It was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition. The end of daylight and arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection. She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine: preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.

When she finally stood, the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room, Alice felt a gentle contentment. Gratitude, even. For the stories, yes—and for the world beyond them, for the tactile, living reality she inhabits. And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks: for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment.
