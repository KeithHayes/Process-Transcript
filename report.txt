Current status:   

Output is generated, but the program algorithm has not been clearly defined until now.  Therefore the project must be examined and 
compared to the following logic and corrected as needed.

Purpose.  To identify sentences and punctuate and correct them when they are found.  Leaving other text unchanged.


Algorithm design :

Considering the previous chunk if any as possibly providing the start of a sentence in the new chunk, identify all complete sentences in the chunk. 
If a complete sentence is identified the spelling and punctuation is corrected for that sentence.  Sentences start with a capital letter and end 
with a period or question mark.  Sentences have commas, connecting dashes will not be used.  Text that is not is in a sentence will be unchanged. 
Linefeeds are removed and a space is optionally added to enforce word boundries.

When a new chunk is added it overlaps the previous chunk, allowing the overlapped part to be rewritten subject to new chunk information 
such as the new chunk completeing tthe sentence.

The purpose of the LLM is to identify sentences in a raw audio transcript and gramatically correct them.

Connecting dashes must be replaced with a comma followed by a space or a period followed by two spaces and 
the capital letter of a new sentence as appropriate.

The document is split into multiple chunks with overlap to accomplish the sentence detections across chunk boundaries.

Chunking is along word boundaries.   

Chumking overlap allows corrections on the tail end of formatted output to accomidate information as the new chunk overlap 
replaces the end of the previous chunk as the new chunk is appended to the output.

Example:  If a chunk is 1000 characters long the second chunnk would begin at 800 characters so the 
first 200 characters are copied and possibly reformatted the previous chunk.  

This overlap allows a sentence to be found across a chunk boundry.

The end of the second chunk is at 1800 so the third chunk begins at 1600 to repeat the overlap re-write correction process allowing 
all complete sentences to be identified and gramatically corrected.

This should be a common technique to process a 'translation' in chunks.  The web should be consulted as needed to ensure logic is correct.

Text outside of sentences is unchanged except that line breaks are removed.

A single blank line will divide chunks as they are added to the output file.  These blank lines are invisible to the algorithm and formatting 
process as they are added post processing only to the output file.

The task.  

Complete evaluation of the existing code must be done to see what part of the desired algortithm has been implemented and to 
determine what must be corrected.

Complete files will be returned so python maintains correct indentation should there be any changes in python files.

Current output in 'formatted_transcript.txt' does not match 'desired_output.txt'.  Correction is required.  Verify the tail of the 
output is rewritten correctly and that the complete imput transcript.txt is processed.

Alice Warren sat by a large window in the corner of her study as the late afternoon sunlight gently illuminated the wooden floor. She loved the peaceful atmosphere created by the hushed silence and the sound of turning pages. The room was filled with countless rows of books that lined every inch of the walls, providing hours of enjoyable reading. It was here where Alice sought refuge from her busy workday, consisting of meetings, presentations, and constant emails. In this serene environment, the stillness wasn't just an absence of noise; rather, it became a soothing presence, guiding her thoughts into calm reflection. Outside, her immaculate garden came alive under the.

Alice sat outside in her meticulously maintained garden, admiring the small creatures that flitted amongst the wild clover. Occasionally, an orange butterfly with delicately veined wings would dance by, captivating her attention briefly. She returned to her book - an anthology filled with tales from early 20th century America - appreciative of their ability to weave mundane daily activities into compelling narratives. The aged pages were marked by years of careful handling; yet, despite their age, the words remained clear as day upon them. Each author skillfully captured time, place and character through richly detailed descriptions which Alice found truly charming.

Alice read two stories by different authors. Each story was filled with vivid descriptions that brought characters' lives to life before her very eyes. She appreciated their attention to detail; even seemingly insignificant actions spoke volumes about each individual's dreams, fears, and internal struggles. In one tale, a girl stood by a river watching its currents flow towards an ominous horizon - it was mesmerizing how something so mundane could contain so many hidden depths. The narrative continued when the young lady lifted her arms upwards, allowing herself to be caressed by the cool breeze. This simple gesture evoked intense emotions within Alice, making her feel like she too.

Alice's heart raced as he approached; his presence filled the room like an invisible force. She felt both terrified and exhilarated by the intensity of their connection. The silence hung heavy between them, punctuated only by their ragged breathing. Finally, unable to bear the tension any longer, she broke away from his gaze and busied herself pouring two cups of coffee from the pot that sat steaming on the table before them. As she handed him one, their fingers brushing against each other sent shockwaves through her system once more. They took turns sipping from the mugs in awkward silence until finally speaking about anything but what was truly weighing.

Alice looked up as their names were called, setting down her nearly full plate. She turned towards him, offering a polite smile before following after the server who led them through the busy dining hall until they reached a quiet table tucked away near one of the towering windows overlooking the expansive grounds outside.

Alice looked up as he approached, her eyes brightening slightly at his presence. She smiled politely and followed him through the bustling dining hall until they arrived at a secluded table by one of the massive windows overlooking the lush grounds outside. After setting the book down on the shelf beside her chair, Alice took a moment to savor the last sip of tea from her cup - an act of mindfulness amidst the chaos around them. With nothing but silence now filling their space, she allowed herself to gradually wind down from her reading while taking note of how quickly darkness fell upon them; marking both ends and beginnings within a single breath span between day and night activities such.

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study. The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls. She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink. It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains. The silence was not merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself, a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.

Outside, the garden lay in gentle bloom. Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness. A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects among the wild clover. Occasionally, a butterfly—orange with black-veined wings—fluttered past the aging glass, and Alice followed its slow, drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book. Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty. It was a lesson she had learned, early and often: that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy; they are small, quiet, and easily overlooked.

Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap. The paper was slightly yellowed, but sturdy; the ink, crisp. Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time, place, and character. There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions—tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon. Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life, and it fascinated Alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual’s hopes, fears, and inner world.

In one story, a young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future. The description was simple: “She lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool, early-spring wind play through her fingers.” Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing. Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, and for a moment, she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene. Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window.

The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold. Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool. She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her. It held a fragrant chamomile infusion, with just a hint of honey. Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup, the one painted with delicate blue forget‑me‑nots. She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind. It had become something of a ritual, this tea-drinking ritual, a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.

Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story. This one described an early morning in a busy city: horse-drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones, merchants hawking wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues. As she read, Alice imagined herself there: she could almost hear the clip-clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot, the weight of her satchel on her shoulder. Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality. Such was the power of fine writing—it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.

By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely. The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair. Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth. In the distance, a lone streetlamp flickered to life; its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs. Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.

She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being. It was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition. The end of daylight and arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection. She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine: preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.

When she finally stood, the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room, Alice felt a gentle contentment. Gratitude, even. For the stories, yes—and for the world beyond them, for the tactile, living reality she inhabits. And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks: for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment.
