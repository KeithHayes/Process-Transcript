This is a two step process and the processes are being debugged together because they are interdependent.


The test.py file is needs to be rewritten.  Only file to be changed is test.py.  The LLM will be debugged using test.py only.  
Only after the test.py can identify the sentences in the first 250 words in transcript_preprocessed.txt and delineate them 
with newlines instead of the spaces used now.

First the LLM will identify existing sentences in the test text which is the first chunk of 250 words 
which ends with a space.  The test code will read the input from preprocessed.txt

Preserve all original words exactly
Maintain original word order
Do not add any new content
A newline replaces the space in front of a sentence that was originally a word separator.
A newline replaces the space at the end of a sentence that was originally a word separator.

This is the end of step one.  Sentences are identified, and where they are identified as complete they are 
punctuated with newline characters replacing the spaces before and after the sentence unless the space is 
after the last word in which case the space remains.

This puts each identified sentence on a separate line.

End of the first step.

Next step:

In a post processing step regular expressions will remove all sentence formatting artifacts retaining only newlines.

if everything is correct the end string length will match the input length.  All that has happened is that the sentences
identified by the LLM are on separate lines.  Processing by regular expression is to remove unwanted formatting that the LLm 
may have added.

current error test is not revealing the string differences well

alice warren sat beside a wide
window in the corner of her study the
late afternoon light slanted gently
across the hardwood floor illuminating
endless rows of books that lined the
walls she loved the hush of quiet
contemplation the soft rustle of
turning pages and the subtle comfort
of stories held within paper and ink
it was in this exact space that she
found solace after a long day of
meetings presentations and endless
email chains the silence was not
merely an absence of noise it was a
presence in itself a companion that
whispered in comfortable tones and
allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered
outside the garden lay in gentle
bloom roses of deep crimson and pale
pink nodded in the early breeze while
lavender and thyme filled the
afternoon air with fragrant sweetness
a pair of robins hopped atop the low
stone wall pecking at small insects
among the wild clover occasionally a
butterfly orange with black veined
wings fluttered past the aging glass
and alice followed its slow drifting
flight for a moment before returning
to her book such ordinary spectacles
when observed with attention held a
profound beauty it was a lesson she
had learned early and often that the
marvels of life are seldom grand or
flashy they are small quiet and
easily overlooked her book an anthology of 
short stories from the early twentieth 
century lay open on her lap the paper 
was slightly yellowed but sturdy the 
ink crisp each story contained within 
had been selected for its faithful
representation of time place and
character there was a certain charm
in the way authors of that era wove
descriptive passages around otherwise
trivial actions tying shoelaces
pouring tea gazing out toward a
stormy horizon such attentiveness to
detail formed a tapestry of everyday
life and it fascinated alice how these
small gestures could reveal so much
about an individuals hopes fears and
inner world
in one story a young woman stood at the
edge of a river watching the current
drift by as though it carried with it
unspoken promises of a distant future
the description was simple she lifted
her hands above her head letting the
cool early spring wind play through
her fingers yet that image carried
emotion enough to fill a lifetime of
longing alice closed her eyes
imagining the wind on her skin and for
a moment she felt transported away
from her study to that riverside scene
then she opened her eyes again setting
the bookmark between the pages and
raised her gaze to the window
the sun had sunk lower the sky had
begun to shift to ethereal shades of
lavender and gold soon the garden
would blur into silhouettes and the
air would cool she reached for the
small porcelain teapot on the table
beside her it held a fragrant
chamomile infusion with just a hint
of honey alice poured the steaming
liquid into her favorite cup the one
painted with delicate blue forget me
nots she paused to inhale the warm
steam allowing its gentle scent to
settle her mind it had become something
of a ritual this tea drinking ritual
a momentary pause between the realms
of thought and rest
turning back to her anthology she
selected a different story this one
described an early morning in a busy
city horse drawn carriages rattling
over cobblestones merchants hawking
wares at street stalls and the clamor
of voices in unfamiliar tongues as she
read alice imagined herself there she
could almost hear the clip clop of
hooves and feel the rough stone
underfoot the weight of her satchel
on her shoulder again she closed her
eyes letting the sounds and textures
swirl around her senses until she
could scarcely distinguish them from
her own reality such was the power of
fine writing it created an illusion
so vivid so grounded that the line
between reader and narrator blurred
by the time she finished the second
story darkness had fallen completely
the study lamp cast a soft pool of
light around her chair beyond the
window the garden was now a shadowy
realm defined only by silhouettes and
the glimmer of a single landing moth
in the distance a lone streetlamp
flickered to life its orange glow
rebounded off dewy leaves turning them
into luminous orbs alice closed the
anthology pressed a finger against the
spine and slid the book into its place
on the shelf
she sat for a moment longer teacup in
hand simply being it was a practice
in mindfulness in appreciating
transition the end of daylight and
arrival of evening the movement from
narrative to reflection she allowed
herself this small pause before rising
to begin the next phase of her evening
routine preparing a light supper
writing a few thoughtful entries in
her journal and perhaps stepping out
onto the back porch to breathe beneath
a sky of stars
when she finally stood the teacup
empty the anthology closed and the
quiet settled deeply over the room
alice felt a gentle contentment
gratitude even for the stories yes and
for the world beyond them for the
tactile living reality she inhabits
and so at the close of day she gave
thanks for words for solitude and for
the small wonders that attend each
ordinary moment

alice warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study the late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls she loved the hush of quiet contemplation the soft rustle of turning pages and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink it was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings presentations and endless email chains the silence was not merely an absence of noise it was a presence in itself a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered outside the garden lay in gentle bloom roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness a pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall pecking at small insects among the wild clover occasionally a butterfly orange with black veined wings fluttered past the aging glass and alice followed its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book such ordinary spectacles when observed with attention held a profound beauty it was a lesson she had learned early and often that the marvels

Alice followed its slow drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book,such ordinary spectacles when observed with attention held a profound beauty. It was a lesson she had learned early and often that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy;they are small,quiet,and easily overlooked. Her book,an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century,lay open on her lap. The paper was slightly yellowed but sturdy,and the ink crisp. Each story contained within The selection process involved choosing works that accurately represented their respective times, places, and characters. There was something charming about the meticulous attention authors of those eras paid to even seemingly mundane activities - like tying shoelaces or pouring tea - skillfully weaving detailed descriptions into larger narratives which painted vivid pictures of daily life experiences shared universally across humanity; small gestures revealing profound insights about people's aspirations, anxieties, dreams... In one particular tale featuring a young lady standing beside a tranquil stream amidst early-spring breezes, readers were privy to intimate glimpses of her innermost thoughts and Alice found herself transported away from her study to that riverside scene, then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages. She raised her gaze to the window - the sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold. Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool. Reaching for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her, Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup - the one painted with delicate blue forget-me-nots. Pausing to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind, early morning in a busy city horse drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones merchants hawking wares at street stalls and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues as she read alice imagined herself there she could almost hear the clip clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot the weight of her satchel on her shoulder again she closed her eyes letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality such was the power of fine writing it created an illusion so vivid so grounded that the line between reader and narrator blurred by the time she finished the second story darkness had fallen completely the study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair beyond the window the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth in the distance a lone streetlamp flickered to life its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves turning them into luminous orbs alice closed the anthology pressed a finger against the spine and slid the book into its place on the shelf she sat for a moment longer teacup in hand simply being it was a practice in mindfulness in appreciating transition the end of daylight and arrival of evening the movement from narrative to reflection she allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine preparing a light supper writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars when she finally stood the teacup empty the anthology closed and the quiet settled deeply over the room alice felt a gentle contentment gratitude even for the stories yes and for the world beyond them for the tactile living reality she inhabits and so at the close of day she gave thanks for words for solitude and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment
