The only file to be modified is process.py

I use an array of characters and process it to find words, but the code I have in 
savechunk(self): converts the array into a string and then processes the string.

This technique is superior to what I have in the other class definitions in process.py

Change the code to match the technique.

class ParseFile:
    input_pointer = 0
    output_pointer = 0
    input_array = []
    chunk = []
    output_array = []


input_array, chunk, output_array will be strings

make no otther improvements than to refine the string processing to replace array processing in the 
ParseFile class.

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study. The late-afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls. She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink. It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains. The silence wasn't merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself—a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered. Outside,

the place and character were described in such a charming way that Alice couldn't help but be captivated. The author of that era skillfully wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions like tying shoelaces, pouring tea, or simply gazing out toward a stormy horizon. Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life which revealed so much about an individual's hopes, fears, and inner world within just one story. In another passage, a young woman stood

In another passage, a young woman stood there, feeling transported away from her study to that riverside scene. She opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window. The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold. Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool. Reaching for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her, which held a fragrant chamomile infusion with just a hint of honey, Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup - the one painted with delicate blue forget-me

—the one painted with delicate blue forget-me-nots." Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story.

As she read, Alice imagined herself there. She

"As she read, Alice imagined herself there. She cast a soft pool of light around her chair—beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm defined only by silhouettes, and the glimmer of a single landing moth in the distance; a lone streetlamp flickered to life, its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs.

She sat for a moment longer, tea cup in hand, simply being — it was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition, the end of daylight and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars. When she finally stood the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room. Alice felt a gentle contentment, gratitude even for the stories; yes, and for the world beyond them. For the tactile, living reality she inhabited, and so at the close of day, she gave thanks for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attended each ordinary moment.

Alice Warren sat beside a wide window in the corner of her study. The late afternoon light slanted gently across the hardwood floor, illuminating endless rows of books that lined the walls. She loved the hush of quiet contemplation, the soft rustle of turning pages, and the subtle comfort of stories held within paper and ink. It was in this exact space that she found solace after a long day of meetings, presentations, and endless email chains. The silence was not merely an absence of noise; it was a presence in itself, a companion that whispered in comfortable tones and allowed thoughts to drift unencumbered.

Outside, the garden lay in gentle bloom. Roses of deep crimson and pale pink nodded in the early breeze, while lavender and thyme filled the afternoon air with fragrant sweetness. A pair of robins hopped atop the low stone wall, pecking at small insects among the wild clover. Occasionally, a butterfly—orange with black-veined wings—fluttered past the aging glass, and Alice followed its slow, drifting flight for a moment before returning to her book. Such ordinary spectacles, when observed with attention, held a profound beauty. It was a lesson she had learned, early and often: that the marvels of life are seldom grand or flashy; they are small, quiet, and easily overlooked.

Her book, an anthology of short stories from the early twentieth century, lay open on her lap. The paper was slightly yellowed, but sturdy; the ink, crisp. Each story contained within had been selected for its faithful representation of time, place, and character. There was a certain charm in the way authors of that era wove descriptive passages around otherwise trivial actions—tying shoelaces, pouring tea, gazing out toward a stormy horizon. Such attentiveness to detail formed a tapestry of everyday life, and it fascinated Alice how these small gestures could reveal so much about an individual’s hopes, fears, and inner world.

In one story, a young woman stood at the edge of a river, watching the current drift by as though it carried with it unspoken promises of a distant future. The description was simple: “She lifted her hands above her head, letting the cool, early-spring wind play through her fingers.” Yet that image carried emotion enough to fill a lifetime of longing. Alice closed her eyes, imagining the wind on her skin, and for a moment, she felt transported away from her study to that riverside scene. Then she opened her eyes again, setting the bookmark between the pages, and raised her gaze to the window.

The sun had sunk lower; the sky had begun to shift to ethereal shades of lavender and gold. Soon, the garden would blur into silhouettes, and the air would cool. She reached for the small porcelain teapot on the table beside her. It held a fragrant chamomile infusion, with just a hint of honey. Alice poured the steaming liquid into her favorite cup, the one painted with delicate blue forget‑me‑nots. She paused to inhale the warm steam, allowing its gentle scent to settle her mind. It had become something of a ritual, this tea-drinking ritual, a momentary pause between the realms of thought and rest.

Turning back to her anthology, she selected a different story. This one described an early morning in a busy city: horse-drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones, merchants hawking wares at street stalls, and the clamor of voices in unfamiliar tongues. As she read, Alice imagined herself there: she could almost hear the clip-clop of hooves and feel the rough stone underfoot, the weight of her satchel on her shoulder. Again, she closed her eyes, letting the sounds and textures swirl around her senses until she could scarcely distinguish them from her own reality. Such was the power of fine writing—it created an illusion so vivid, so grounded, that the line between reader and narrator blurred.

By the time she finished the second story, darkness had fallen completely. The study lamp cast a soft pool of light around her chair. Beyond the window, the garden was now a shadowy realm, defined only by silhouettes and the glimmer of a single landing moth. In the distance, a lone streetlamp flickered to life; its orange glow rebounded off dewy leaves, turning them into luminous orbs. Alice closed the anthology, pressed a finger against the spine, and slid the book into its place on the shelf.

She sat for a moment longer, teacup in hand, simply being. It was a practice in mindfulness, in appreciating transition. The end of daylight and arrival of evening, the movement from narrative to reflection. She allowed herself this small pause before rising to begin the next phase of her evening routine: preparing a light supper, writing a few thoughtful entries in her journal, and perhaps stepping out onto the back porch to breathe beneath a sky of stars.

When she finally stood, the teacup empty, the anthology closed, and the quiet settled deeply over the room, Alice felt a gentle contentment. Gratitude, even. For the stories, yes—and for the world beyond them, for the tactile, living reality she inhabits. And so, at the close of day, she gave thanks: for words, for solitude, and for the small wonders that attend each ordinary moment.
