Hi everybody. Today is Saturday, June 21st, 2025, and our friend Pepe Escobar is back with us. Welcome back, Pepe.

Pepe:
Nema, always a pleasure. I turned Russia upside down to be here with you tonight. It’s 11 p.m. in Moscow—I just arrived from St. Petersburg to be here on time so we could do this in a relaxed way, at least a little bit.

Nema:
Let’s get started, Pepe, with what’s going on in the Middle East. As time goes by, the situation is getting more dangerous and more fragile. It seems that the United States is escalating—moving fighter jets and bombers close to Iran. They're preparing for an attack. Even CNN has reported this idea of a two-week window. Somehow it feels like a game of deception—meant, of course, to keep Tehran confused. What’s your take on what’s going on?

Pepe:
Can I make an introduction before I answer your question?

Nema:
Go ahead.

Pepe:
Because we need to talk about St. Petersburg. It was the most important forum in Russia this year. I heard from Global South businessmen that, for them, it’s now more important than Davos. Why? Because they’re actually doing business.

This morning, the organizers in St. Petersburg announced—though it’s not the final count—that over $80 billion in deals were signed. That’s enormous by any standard. And the great thing is, these are Global South deals. This isn’t the international banking system. This isn’t BlackRock or the usual suspects. These are deals involving African nations. India and Pakistan were there. Pakistan even sent ministers. The Gulf Cooperation Council was present—Bahrain was one of the guests of honor. Southeast Asia was heavily represented. And of course, scores of African nations.

Naturally, Central Asia, Russia, and China were there too. Just to give you an idea, there was a Russia–China business panel on Wednesday. It was completely packed—people were standing outside because they couldn’t get in. Businessmen from both sides, local governors from different Russian oblasts, all talking about investments. The Russian officials were saying, “Look, the Chinese are investing in this, this, this project.” Amazing stuff.

There was a fantastic panel on international financial reform, and our friend Paulo Batista was the star. Can you imagine? Paulo spoke online for less than 10 minutes and stole the show. The panel was about reforming the international financial system. The Chinese participants were, as always, very cautious: “We must take things one step at a time.” But Paulo cut through that and said what needed to be said: "We have to go for broke. Our window of opportunity is small, and the real reforms must begin now."

That aligns with what the Russians have been working toward since last year—before the BRICS summit in Kazan. As we know, the next summit is in Brazil, so things are slowing down a bit in the Brazilian way. But at least we have people like Paulo, one of the founders of the New Development Bank, who understands that structural reform is essential.

And that kind of discussion—honest, urgent, and practical—you can only have at a forum like this. We had our own panel too. I was on a panel about fake news, but it went far beyond that. We discussed information control, artificial intelligence, and how fake news is increasingly being generated by Big Tech itself.

There was a high-ranking executive from Sberbank—the top Russian bank—sharing astonishing figures on fake news, not just in Russia but globally. When you compare this to the latest revelations about Palantir, it's shocking. Palantir is now embedded within the U.S. federal government. That means a massive AI company—one of the top high-tech firms in the West—is now effectively dictating policy.

How serious is that? These are the people building AI models for the Israelis to use in targeting Palestinians. So yes, it’s getting worse by the minute.

Now, about countering fake news: some Russian colleagues have started an organization called the Global Fact-Checking Network (GFCN). You can find them online—they have their own website. Many people, including myself, have joined. The idea is to create a blueprint for checking fake news and to build momentum for this discussion to eventually reach the BRICS table.

It’s not going to happen in Rio in a few days, of course, but perhaps at the next BRICS summit in South Africa. And if BRICS takes this seriously, we could eventually see the emergence of a BRICS-net, or BRICS-tube—an independent, alternative media sphere. Because we can’t just keep relying on Big Tech platforms—we know where that road leads, especially with dangerous figures like Peter Thiel and Alex Karp (formerly of PayPal) now embedded in the U.S. government.

This forum is changing, Nema. It’s great. It used to be more generalistic, but this year it was full of extremely practical panels—people offering real solutions, from geoeconomics to the IT sphere.

And of course, over it all hangs the dark cloud you asked about: Iran, Israel, and the U.S.—and what the U.S. is going to do.

Everyone was waiting for the plenary session yesterday with President Putin. And for the first time, the Global South was represented on stage. We had China, Indonesia, Bahrain, and South Africa. How cool is that? A true sample of the Global South.

Putin sees Southeast Asia and Africa as two of the most critical development regions in the near future. During his address, he diplomatically addressed the situation with Iran.

First, the Russian position is clear: Iran has the absolute, inalienable right to maintain a civilian nuclear program—which is exactly what they have.

Second, Putin said he received personal assurances from both Trump and Netanyahu that they will not bomb the Bushehr plant. Why? Because there are over 200 ultra high-tech Russian technicians working there. You can imagine how that conversation went—Putin calling and saying, “Don’t touch Bushehr,” and both of them understanding the consequences if they did.

Third, and this is very important: there has been criticism, especially from Russian Atlanticists and across the Global North, that Russia is not doing enough to help Iran. Putin explicitly said that those spreading this narrative are "provocateurs"—a literal translation from Russian.

So yes, they are helping. But discreetly.
