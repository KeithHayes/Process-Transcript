Hi everybody. Today is Saturday, June 21st, 2025. Our friend Pepe Escobar is back with us. Welcome back, Pepe! You always bring interesting insights.
Pepe has kindly agreed to share his views on the current state of affairs in the Middle East. He recently returned from St. Petersburg where he attended the annual economic forum. According to him, this event is far more significant for global South businesses compared to Davos because they are actively engaged in trade and commerce.
Before diving deeper into their discussion on geopolitics, why don't we introduce another guest? Please welcome IA - someone who needs no formal introduction but deserves one noneth.



Name: Guest 1
Message: Gee Rade and Commerce. Before diving deeper into their discussion on geopolitics, let me tell you about what happened at Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum which concluded yesterday. The forum hosted several heads of states and governments, including Vladimir Putin himself. It also witnessed some significant economic announcements. For instance, it has been reported that over $80 billion worth of deals have been sealed during the event. These deals involve countries like Africa, India, Pakistan, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Russia, and China. Additionally, there were numerous panels discussing various aspects of trade between these regions. One such panel discussed how Russia.

The discussion revolves around various topics such as economic reforms, political discourse, and technological advancements. It seems that the pace of change has been slower than expected, especially considering the recent challenges faced globally due to the pandemic. However, some individuals are still pushing forward with their agendas, including Paulo from MDB who recognizes the need for structural changes within economies worldwide.



Paulo: globally due to the pandemic. However, some individuals are still pushing forward with their agendas, including me from MDB who recognizes the need for structural changes within economies worldwide.

a all around bricks alternative media sphere because we cannot simply be subjected to the big tech platforms because we know exactly where it's going with the former PayPal mafia with this very very dangerous characters Peter T and Alex Karp and the fact that they are now part of the US government it's even even more dangerous so the forum was this forum is changing Nema it's great because used to be too generalistic until next year This year there were lots of panels that were extremely practical and people discussing possible solutions Everything from geoeconomics to the IT sphere and of course the overarching theme the dark cloud over all of us is your question Iran Israel and US and what is US going to do Um the everybody was waiting for the plenary session which was yesterday right with President Putin But first great thing about the plenary session the global south was represented on stage at the plenary session we had China Indonesia Bahrain and South Africa How cool is that This is a a sample of the global south uh with the the guest of honor the president of Indonesia prao Southeast Asia which puts Putin sees as one of the two top areas of development in the near future.



Journalist: Name: President Putin, you just returned from your trip to Southeast Asia. Can you tell us more about the significance of this visit?
Putin: Yes, certainly. My visit to Indonesia was aimed at strengthening cooperation between our countries in various fields such as energy, trade, and investment. We also discussed ways to enhance security cooperation against terrorism and other threats. In addition, I held meetings with leaders from ASEAN member states to discuss regional issues including the situation in Ukraine and Syria.

gang but mostly AC across the global north that Russia is not doing enough to um help Iran Putin said explicitly these people who are pedling this notion they are provocators provocati literal translation from from Russian So this means we can infer that of course they are helping discreetly Iran in this is a a taboo subject here uh Nema we cannot discuss this publicly I asked people close to the government about it no answers So we discussed this with the people from think tanks for instance Uh and the answer that they they they give is very similar to the answer that I received in Yemen when I asked a member of the high political council What are your exactly your relations with Russia and China And basically he said very diplomatically yes we have our own channels So obviously Thran and Moscow they have their own channels and obviously nobody here is going to expose these channels and what is the level of collaboration and help from Russia to Iran Same thing about China uh I discussed this for instance with my friend professor Jeang wei way he was in this uh China Russ audience as then he had he had to go to his own panel and he said of course there is but this is uh uh this is.

this for instance with my friend professor Jeang wei way he was in this uh China Russ audience as then he had he had to go to his own panel and he said of course there is but this is uh uh this is not in the open in cannot be in the open in China and it's not the Chinese way of doing the Chinese are extremely discreet especially when it comes to helping a partner that for them is a matter of national security as you know Very well Nema It's not only that deal which is not 10 years it's actually 20 years the $400 billion plus deal between Iran and China energy and infrastructure Uh so it's a matter of national security for China and whatever happens Iran will have China's back China will have Iran's back I'm sorry So so it was good to have even if we had let's say tur and tentative answers but basically you got answers to these questions you know and it was good that this came out in the plenary session especially apart from that ju just to close this introduction the atmosphere was was buzzing everywhere you could you you could feel that there were deals being struck all the time I gave an example in my telegram column I interviewed a high power Chinese CEO dressed Hong Kong style.

"I gave an example in my telegram column I interviewed a high power Chinese CEO dressed Hong Kong style. "

"She said she's going to move she's going to live in Hong Kong next year. "

"Her company wants to invest in Donetsk. "
Name: Interviewer
"This is something that nobody in the west knows. "
Name: Donetsk Official
"In fact then my my Donbas friends they organized an interview with the.

could become uh quite something a mix of a spe um uh special economic zone uh important port and a tourism hub as well So um if you don't go to a forum like this you are literally uh blinded by the western narrative And of course everybody I I talked to people people from Astrakan for instance which is part of the international north south transportation corp they love talking to foreign uh journalists and analysts because they are of course you know it's impossible for them to talk to the west and they are doing absolutely amazing stuff uh in ter in terms of integration they talk about how the federal government is investing a lot in all these oblasts and these uh public private uh partnerships So this is just to give you and our audience a small glimpse of how important this forum was Even all of us hostages of this absolutely horrendous situation in West Asia You have over 10, 000 people over there for three days non-stop networking and doing business So this is the future and it's not it's no wonder that one of the most important quotes from Putin during his plenary session is that he said we uh not only uh we Russia we are betting on bricks as the future but we are betting on.

Name: Speaker A
Speaker B: Yes, exactly. The western media has been spreading false narratives about Iran for years, portraying them as an aggressor nation when in reality they pose no threat to anyone except for those who seek to destabilize the region under the guise of democracy.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2:.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: Not only does Sai Herald discuss how the Iranian system operates, but also delves into their decision-making processes regarding existential threats, neighborly relations within the Arab world, and interactions with broader regions such as Eurasia. Furthermore, he highlights Iran's long-term preparedness for potential conflict due to its understanding that these tensions were likely unavoidable. The underlying theme appears to be the clash between the Turbo Capitalist System and the Islamic Revolution, painting it as an inevitable confrontation. However, critics may argue that reducing complex geopolitical dynamics to a simple dichotomy oversimpl.

Name: Aaron Mate
Speaker: Well I think there's no doubt that Max Blumenthal who is a journalist and author here in the United States someone who really takes seriously the idea of holding power to account He has been doing great work particularly over the last few years exposing corruption within the media and also just shining light on aspects of US foreign policy that aren't covered enough So it's great to see him continuing to do that work  You mentioned that his latest article looks at efforts by certain factions within the Beltway here in Washington DC to push for regime change or war against Iran Now I haven't had a chance to read that particular article yet but based on your description it sounds.

people is terrifying but the problem is some some of these people interviewed by Hirs they have access to decision making in Washington and that's what makes it even more dangerous and it's a quite a collection of of sources you know so if these people actually believe in what they are doing so we better get ready for some sort of apocalypse really apocalypse later not apocalypse now and proving once again that the system in the US is irredeemable It cannot be changed They will only change if they were destroyed completely which is not going to we know it's not going to happen They're still very very powerful Even if they were defeated by the Houthis and now they want to be defeated by the IRGC right It took one month for the Houthis to destro destroy now to completely defeat and humiliate the US Navy So now they want to repeat that with the IRGC That's a really bad move But that's where we're going apparently So it is in every respect Nema It's terrifying because these people they are not illiterate They are not completely dumb but they are fanatic They are extremely misinformed they have uh positions of power in the nomenclature So in a sense I her speech was uh uh it was a.

are not illiterate They are not completely dumb but they are fanatic They are extremely misinformed they have uh positions of power in the nomenclature So in a sense I her speech was uh uh it was a public service for him to public something like this I like his style because he's not judgmental Basically he's reproducing what people told him you know but wow it's one of the most terrifying things I have read in my long long long life around the world Really Pepe when it comes to the attack on Iran and the way that Iran has responded so far if the if Israel is winning what does Donald Trump need to interfere in the conflict Why do they need to go and bomb Iran Israel is winning So let them win the war What's going on that Nema They can't win this war You know that I know that Our most of our audience I'm sure knows that In fact they are losing already They lost the strategic initiative They lost the aura of invincibility for them I I would say that this is a psychological coup even worse than losing everything Nobody is afraid of the Israelis anymore Everybody knows that they are a killing machine But it's very very convenient to be a killing machine uh killing women children.

worse than losing everything Nobody is afraid of the Israelis anymore Everybody knows that they are a killing machine But it's very very convenient to be a killing machine uh killing women children hospitals journalists humanitarian help etc from above with missiles try try to match yourself against a real regional power They are they are having their ass kicked little by little the Iranian way because Iran for the moment hasn't entered a war against Israel They are probing they it's a sort of a little by little escalation to achieve strategic deterrence which in some aspects they they already have There are some serious gaps in their uh anti-aircraft defenses and anti-missile defenses which might maybe they might get help from Russia to plug these holes if they wanted um quoting Putin again Putin said we offered some stuff to Iran Iran said no we don't want it at least for now if they wanted Russia is willing to help them any way they can So even with the fact that they continue to be attacked by Israel several raids a day missiles targeted assassinations you name it But the destruction that they already inflicted in Tel Aviv and beyond is now unimaginable for everyone Nobody.

to be attacked by Israel several raids a day missiles targeted assassinations you name it But the destruction that they already inflicted in Tel Aviv and beyond is now unimaginable for everyone Nobody could ever imagine that missiles will be destroying neighborhoods in Israel landing near Dona destroying most of the port of Hifa The mayor of Hifa is desperate now is begging for peace because his sport sooner or later is going to disappear just like uh a lot was bankrupt Hifa will disappear It's not it's not in in the equation anymore oil the oil refinery in in Hifa Same thing So Israel now for has I would say of their three ports they have maybe 30% left in Ashdod which is near Gaza so it's not very well located the other two are well one of them is non-existence and the other one is slowly sinking so there is a different strategy that was re-elaborated it probably in the first 48 hours by the IRGC I say okay now it's different now it's not strategic patience anymore we going to go best by a thousand cuts and it's working it's working because the number one objective is very ambitious is to paralyze the Israeli economy and they are on the way to do that Nemo seriously with only.

Name: Speaker A
Speaker B:.

Name: Speaker A
Speaker B: They see the big picture ahead? If the Americans get what they want - four B2s dropping four bombs exactly at the same time vertically on the spot over Iran - then it's a completely new ball game. As we know, hitting the exact same spot multiple times isn't easy due to factors like smoke and debris. Plus, someone needs to explain why this plan makes sense considering the risks involved. It seems nobody at the Pentagon has any objections or concerns about such an absurd proposal. The person responsible for this operation appears to be Major Imbecile Gurilla, an Islamophobic individual who should never have been given such.

the whole notion is so absurd that even Trump himself apparently is not convinced Of course I would say a 5-year-old would not be convinced but that's where we are and and it gets more serious by the minute And I'm sure Putin um already via their privileged channels already told Trump look you have no idea what awaits you if you go along with this But at the same time Nema we all know it's not Trump who's making this decision The decision has already been made by the usual suspects behind They are forcing him to of course give the green light It's a completely different story And there are um uh echoes and shades telling us that uh he's he's now afraid because he is totally trapped in his own rhetorical game and in the Zio Con's long running game that comes since the end of the 1990s He's he's in an untenable position and we can already say that he lost the midterms His base half of his base is gone already So bye-bye He's going to be a lame duck after the midterms Not to mention they they might advance to try to impeach him again So it's wow The accumulation of horrors and absurdities is never ending right And when you of course all of us who for professional reasons we have to.

they might advance to try to impeach him again So it's wow The accumulation of horrors and absurdities is never ending right And when you of course all of us who for professional reasons we have to at least uh get a glimpse of what mainstream media is saying they live in what kind of re now obviously these people don't live in reality but what kind of nether world they live and ping the notion that I know it's the president of the United States is Like God he can decide one day to do the or zeals He he can decide one day to throw a lightning bolt and the other day okay let's have a banquet He decides the future of the world No he doesn't decide anything There are people deciding for him He's basically a lowly messenger a cheap messenger a casino hustler you know a mobster a subm mobster So it's uh it was good to have a few um uh inside um info and commentary from from people in St Petersburg Well well positioned people in the Russian government especially they have no they have no illusions of course and once again they all come back to the same point We have a war here in our borders First we need to solve this and now they're fully concentrated uh what's going to happen in the.

Name:
Russia's foreign policy has been focused on its own security interests amidst increasing geopolitical instability caused by NATO expansionism towards Eastern Europe while simultaneously dealing with an internal conflict within Ukraine's borders where separatist groups supported financially politically by Moscow are engaged militarily against government forces backed economically diplomatically by Western powers led primarily by Washington D C .

Name: Vladimir Putin
Speech: The United States and its allies support Ukrainian reforms while opposing separatists, whereas Russia supports separatists and opposes Ukraine's integration into NATO. These tensions lead to military conflict between government forces and pro-Russia rebels. Regarding Iran, Putin acknowledges the presence of over one million former Soviet Union citizens holding dual passports in Israel but emphasizes that Iran remains an important partner for Russia despite U. S. -led sanctions and pressures.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2:.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: was around September September October So a few months before shock and all And I saw by myself how the country was impoverished after how many 20 years almost 20 years of sanctions destroyed Uh the only thing that more or less worked was the mukabarat the intel services and it would be very easy if the Americans launched and it was uh and even like that it took three three weeks for the whole thing to collapse and it only collapsed because they distributed a lot of money to Saddam's generals Iran now Iran is solid even of course there is oppos you know of course there is opposition uh to the government especially in north Iran the upper middle class the people who dream of Iran under the sha etc but it's a minority in Iran uh so and the fact that now the nation was attacked directly it unified the nation completely as you know very well Nema but try to explain this in Washington Nobody will understand First of all these idiots never been to Iran They don't know how it works They don't know anything The culture history how the system works You name it Uh different levels of popularity If you compare uh Kistan with Mashad with the Caspian with the Persian Gulf and they don't even.

"I don't know anything about their culture, history, or how the system works, " You stated bluntly. Different levels of popularity exist between various regions within Iran - from Khuzestan Province near Iraq border all the way up north towards Azerbaijan Republic sharing its borders along the Caspian Sea coastline; each region holds unique values which may not align perfectly across these vast distances. It seems many locals harbor an intense hatred for current leadership figures such as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei but lack understanding regarding potential alternatives available through democratic processes.

Name: Medvedev
Speaker: ls
Medvedev: You and me both, sir. This is extremely serious. All indications point towards impending conflict between our two nations due to misguided policies on both sides. A catastrophic mistake could be made by either party resulting in disastrous consequences for everyone involved. No one seems willing to listen or take heed of these warnings though.

Name: Escalating Tensions - Speaker 1
It seems like we are heading towards a potential conflict between multiple nations. The situation involving Iran continues to escalate and now includes threats from various other countries as well. This is incredibly concerning given the high stakes involved and the fact that miscalculations can easily lead to devastating consequences for all parties involved. Despite repeated warnings from experts and leaders around the world, no one appears ready to step back from the brink of war. Both Iran and the US appear determined to engage in hostilities which makes de-escalation even more challenging. In addition, other countries like Yemen and potentially China are also voicing their support for oppos.



Victor: The US appears determined to engage in hostilities, making de-escalation even more challenging. Additionally, other countries like Yemen and potentially China are supporting Iran against these unfair sanctions. This situation resembles an undeclared war or a surprise attack, giving Iran full legal justification to defend itself.
Nema: Exactly. The leadership in Beijing shares this viewpoint. They believe that if attacked, Iran has every right to fight back. Furthermore, they imply their willingness to assist Iran in ways we cannot imagine through discrete actions characteristic of their diplomacy style – similar to what we saw between Russia and Iran regarding drone shipments during the Ukraine conflict.



Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly. The Russian-Iranian relationship has been built over decades and involves various aspects such as energy cooperation, military alliances, cultural exchanges, etc. On the other hand, India tends to be more opportunistic when dealing with these two nations by taking advantage of their conflicts or interests without truly committing itself. This could potentially lead to misunderstandings down the line if India continues along this path instead of developing deeper ties based on mutual respect and shared values like its counterparts in the SCO.

at India They say do they really belong here you see and it's completely stupid because they depend on Russia they depend on Iran They are partners in the international north south transportation corridor which is a lifeline commercial lifeline for them But the relationship between New Delhi and Tel Aviv is wow this is quite something And of course don't forget the affinity the ideological affinities between Zionism and Hindutva uh supremacism That's not good at all You know Axis Pepe Axis reported that the United States tried to set up a meeting with Iran in Estanul but it didn't work Supreme leader Yeah refused to talk with the United States But we know that the Iranian foreign minister went to Europe He talked with foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom together with Germany and France The outcome of that those talks they were they were just repeating the same sort of demands on the part of the United States No enrichment even they want to bring in the missile the the missile program of Iran Unbelievable I don't know if it seems as time goes by Iran sees no solution but fight in the United States Yes Uhhuh The Shihuawas uh you saw the Shihu were.



John: Hello? Can you hear me?
Bob: Yes, Bob here. What's up John?
John: Just wanted to discuss something important with you. Have you been following the news about Iran lately?
Bob: Of course. Why do you ask?
Jane: Hi guys. Sorry for interrupting. But have either of you heard of Zero Enrichment?
Both: No, Jane. We haven't heard about it. Could you please explain?
Jane: Sure. Apparently, some countries like France and Germany are pushing for Iran to stop all their nuclear activities including enrichment programs completely. They even want them to dismantle their entire nuclear infrastructure.



Name: Person A
Person B:.

Name: Person A
Person B: Far from being weakened, they actually got rid of all their older missiles. Instead of depleting the interceptor fleets, they replenished them. This shows that simple yet effective strategies really work. Now, let's see how they handle the newer models when those start flying off their production lines. The Israelis and Americans should take note; it seems clear that these straightforward approaches can be quite successful.

Sergey Glaziev: We see what happened after the Maidan coup in 2014 - an attempt to seize power in Ukraine failed. Then came the Special Military Operation (SMO), which aimed to resolve the issue peacefully but also achieved military goals quickly due to its simplicity. Now, we face new challenges such as negotiating resolutions for both the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and potential tensions between Iran and Western powers over oil prices. These events seem interconnected, suggesting a larger geopolitical strategy at play involving control of natural resources across multiple countries. As we move forward through these complicated situations, understanding their connections becomes increasingly important for making informed decisions about international relations.

John Smith: The situation between Russia and multiple countries is becoming complex. Understanding their connections is crucial for decision-making in international relations. We've reached Level Four now; the countries involved seem desperate as they realize they cannot win at this stage. Can they initiate a nuclear war against Russia? Absolutely not - they would only suffer defeat. Do they possess sufficient capabilities to attack Russia directly? Definitely not. Accepting strategic defeat doesn't change anything either. Regime change in Iran might offer some hope initially, but false flags in Taiwan could escalate tensions further down the line, leading us back to square one. This pattern reveals an alarming level of desperation among those who.

Name: Speaker A
Speaker B:.

Name: Speaker A
Name: Speaker B.

Name: Speaker A
Name: Speaker B again So okay All that to say in a somewhat convoluted way forgive me all of you that maybe this could be the beginning for a resurrection of Palestine later on because if Zion if Zionism machine is shattered they will naturally dissolve and that thing will dissolve and they will go back to Poland Ukraine even Russia Yeah Eastern Europe in general Well and that's it And the land will return to their rightful owners Here is Pepe Here is what Donald Trump said Yes Foreign Minister this afternoon said if the US is serious about negotiations that you would call up Israel and request that they stop their air strikes Will you make that request Well I think it's very hard to make that request right now If somebody's winning it's a little bit harder to do than if somebody's losing But we're ready willing and able And we've been speaking to Iran and we'll see what happens Yeah He feels that he's winning Pepe I Nema they are not they're not giving him the right information Simple as that It's obvious It's he doesn't know anything that's going on over there obviously and he doesn't read Once again we we already discussed that many times A president that doesn't read and works by uh TV uh.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2:.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: could meet  Trump and tell him five minutes look the whole thing is absurd But would he listen? Of course not. Even if that happened. The United States has brought their fighter jet to Saudi Arabia. Do you believe if they wanted to attack Iran they would use Saudi Arabia? Because I would say that that would be the end of Saudi Arabia. That would be the end of Saudi family.
Well, NBS isn't losing sleep on all that. Obviously he knows NBS is not a fool. He may be a gangster but he's not a fool. , yeah, we we we don't.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: Yeah, well. . .
Speaker 3: You know?
Speaker 4: Well. . .
Name: Pepe Escobar
Speaker 1: . . . Nobody's talking about World War III anymore?
Speaker 2: Exactly. Nobody wants that.
Speaker 3: Everybody just wants peace.
Speaker 4: Right. But what happens if Israel attacks Iran using NATO countries' naval forces? Won't that lead to a global catastrophe?
Name: Pepe Escobar
People are aware that such an action could have disastrous consequences. However, there seems.

be devastating We're going to destroy Iranian nuclear facilities and all of that I we know these sort of rhetorics They're they they want to make the case for the administration to go after the plan to attack Iran They don't care about the outcome They don't care about what's going on in the aftermath of that attack But that would be the end of Donald Trump and his administration in my opinion because look at what's going on in the United States with MAGA Look at what's going on with Tucker Carlson It's not just about Taco Carson Matt Gates Somehow they tried to convince or somehow put pressure on Tulsi Gabbard She backed down in her recent tweet on X But after all you cannot change the base You cannot change the mindset of those people who voted for you who wanted some sort of change These are big things that are happening in the in my opinion in the mind of Donald Trump himself before going to Iran It's not just about Iran It's about the future of the United States Absolutely Um well once again he's caught in a net in a very elaborated trap set up by the Zionist axis and he's expendable Nema He's another expendable US president If his presidency implodes because of a out of.

Name: 
"Once again, " started Speaker A, "he's caught in an elaborate trap. " They went on to explain that President Obama was seen as expendable by the Zionist axis due to their larger goals. "If his presidency implodes. . . ", continued Speaker A, setting up a hypothetical scenario where President Obama would be deemed useless. This narrative was based on fear; Speaker B interjected that this has been the case for some time now. The discussion then shifted towards how long it might take to remove such influential figures within the U. S. government. In conclusion, both speakers agreed that there seemed to be no end in sight without significant.



Pepe: How do you see the current political climate regarding foreign policy specifically concerning nations like Syria and Iran? Do you believe there will ever be any significant change or are those entities too deeply entrenched within the American power structure for any real progress to occur?

is looking at what's going on and they say "So who are you to support Who are you to come to the to fight Iran You have no problem with Iran It's all about Iran and Israel The United States wants to back Israel They can come in fight Iran What is what it has to do with Germany and the United Kingdom Unless you think that the Israeli project is the is a British project they need to go Uh Germany and France are inconsequential So whatever they do nobody cares because they are inconsequential The Brits is different It's MI6 So it's regime change For the Brits is regime change It's the same Uh the way MI6 and the British ruling classes look at Iran is exactly the way the Zionist look at Iran Regime change We did a puppet over there and we need to make a lot of money out of re Iran's national natural resources and of course block exactly u this association between Russia Iran and China this is what really matters ana in the European theater France and Germany they don't even qualify as a consequences nobody can their army they cannot fight a a war in a basta inconsequential the outcome Pepe if the United States finally decides to attack Iran I would say they're not going to be able to.



Name: Speaker 1
The consequence of an attack on Iran by the United States is something no one should take lightly. The outcome could be catastrophic; their army cannot win against such a powerful enemy. Therefore, even if they were to attempt a counterattack, it wouldn't make much difference due to its inconsequential nature.

uh Nema Uh your conversations with Iranians this past few days this is a national consensus If the US enters the war we will fight with everything that we end It's the end It's the end of oppositions It It's the end of anything that the West was somehow investing in in investing in in for many years For many years these people you you see the crown the the son of Sha of Iran coming out and coordinating with Israelis and the and and Americans in terms of fighting He was asked "Do you care about the British media was asking him do you care about that Israelis are attacking civilians in Iran? " They don't want to attack civilians He actually said that He said this Wow Wow These people are totally in bed with what's going on in they want to literally they want to divide Iran in oblast and they want to Kurds Turks Arabs Beluchis and all of this This is the main goal the endgame on their part in my opinion and and Iran knows this These are huge These these are smart people These are not some ordinary people talking about because they they want to hear the argument on the part of the west They know what they're doing and they were preparing for this They knew that this would come to them.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2:
Name: John Doe.

Name: Speaker 1
Name: John Doe
John Doe: Analyze Iran based on the differences between North Iran (wealthy) and South Iran (proletarian).
No, it's much more complex than that.
Exactly. Let's see what would happen. . .
But I don't see anything.
What's what's your feeling?
Mima Ser: Without political or geopolitical analysis, my feeling is what I hear from inside Iran; as time goes by, these attacks are continuing on Iranian people, their unity grows stronger. I see even liberals in the north of Iran coming together with those in the south, those villagers in.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2:.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: Asia They're going to learn it if they go with the attack on Iran They're going to learn it They're going to find something that has never happened before to the United States It's something big It's something big there there must be there shall be prepared they shall prepare for that in in my opinion it's yeah the only thing that I can say and but I don't see the sanity in the administration I was somehow hope I I was hoping that these people like like the vice president of the United States JD Vance would be the the voice of sanity he's not he's not he's is trying to he.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: Papy.
