Alice Warren sat by a large window in the corner of her study as the late afternoon sunlight gently illuminated the wooden floor. She loved the peaceful atmosphere created by the hushed silence and the sound of turning pages. The room was filled with countless rows of books that lined every inch of the walls, providing hours of enjoyable reading. It was here where Alice sought refuge from her busy workday, consisting of meetings, presentations, and constant emails. In this serene environment, the stillness wasn't just an absence of noise; rather, it became a soothing presence, guiding her thoughts into calm reflection.
