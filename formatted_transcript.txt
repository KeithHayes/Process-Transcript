Hi everybody Today is Saturday June 21st 2025 and our friend Pepe Escobar is back with us Welcome back Pepe Nema Always a pleasure I turned uh Russia upside down to be here with you tonight It's 11 in Moscow I just arrived from St Petersburg to be here on time so we could do this relaxed you know at least a little bit Let's let's get started Pepe with what's going on in the Middle East The situation as time goes by is getting more dangerous more fragile And it seems that the United States is doing everything just moving these fighter jets bombers close to Iran They're preparing for an attack on Iran Even CNN reported that this sort of idea of two weeks and there's somehow there it's a game of deception Of course to keep Therron confused Your take on what's going on U can I make an introduction IA before I answer your question Go ahead Because we need to talk about St Petersburg Yeah Uh it was the most important forum in Russia this year and I heard from global south businessmen in St Petersburg that for them is much more important than Davos Why Because they are doing business This morning uh the organizers in St Petersburg they announced that uh okay this is not the final count.

Petersburg that for them is much more important than Davos Why Because they are doing business This morning uh the organizers in St Petersburg they announced that uh okay this is not the final count over $80 billion dollar of deals were signed in St Petersburg that's enormous by any standards and the great thing is these are global south deals this is not uh international banking system this is not black rock you know the usual suspects these are African nations uh India and Pakistan were there uh the Pakistanis they sent ministers you know uh the Gulf cooperation council Bahin was one of the guests of honor Southeast Asia Everybody from Southeast Asia was there and of course scores of African nations So and obviously Central Asia Russia China There was so just to give you an idea there was uh in the middle of uh on Wednesday there was uh Russia China business panel packed totally packed people out of the room because they couldn't get into the room businessmen from both sides local governors in Russia different oblasts and everybody uh talking business and uh uh the local go Russian government saying look the Chinese are investing in this this this this project amazing stuff you.

governors in Russia different oblasts and everybody uh talking business and uh uh the local go Russian government saying look the Chinese are investing in this this this this project amazing stuff you know uh there was a wonderful panel which our friend Apollo Batista he he was the star of the panel online can imagine Paulo talked online for less than 10 minutes and told the show it was a panel uh about um a possible reform of the international financial system and the Russians there was a there was a Chinese there was one Chinese as they were too uh careful they you know ah we have to go little by little one step at a time and all that and Paulo says the real thing no we have to go for broke and our window of opportunity is is you know it's quite small and the the real important reforms they have to start now which is what the Russians were saying and working for last year before the brick summit in Kazan last year because as we all know the summit is in Brazil this year everything is slowing down the Brazilian way but at least we have people like Paulo one of the founders of the MDB new development bank He knows that there's got to be a structural reform of the NDP and all that.



Name: John Smith
Speaker 1: But at least we have people like Paolo, one of the founders of the MDB New Development Bank. He knows that there needs to be a structural reform of the NDP and all that. It's just slowing down the Brazilian way.
Speaker 2: That's true. And this kind of discussion isn't really happening even in countries like Russia or China. You know, it takes a place like this to have such conversations. Our own panel on fake news went far beyond that too - we talked about controlling information, artificial intelligence, and how big tech will soon produce digital fake news themselves. The implications are immense; when.

Jimmy Dore: Yeah, well I mean what's happening right now. . . the repercussions from Twitter censorship are being felt worldwide right? Like you look at Brazil, Bolsonaro was elected based on his anti corruption stance, he has taken on big corporations like Facebook and Google before, so obviously the left hates him and wants him gone. But he hasn't been removed yet, he got elected fair and square, even though they don't like him, but now with Twitter banning conservatives wholesale, who knows if he could survive another election cycle?

Name: Person 1
Twitter ban conservatives, Trump reelection chances, Big Tech monopoly, PayPal mafia involvement in govt.
Solution: Alternative media spheres needed. Forum changed this year by having more practical sessions focused on real-world problems. Geoeconomics, IT sphere discussed along with overarching themes such as Iran-Israel tensions and potential actions by USA. Global South representation important; includes China, Indonesia, Bahrain, and South Africa speaking at Plenary Session led by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Question: What do you know about Russia's involvement in assisting Iran? 
Answer: According to Putin, those claiming Russia isn't doing enough to support Iran are provoking. In Russian, 'provokatsi' translates directly to 'provocateur'. This implies some level of secretive assistance being provided by Russia towards Iran. When asking people close to the government or think tank experts about this topic, responses were met with silence or vague acknowledgements of existing channels between countries without divulging specific details on levels of collaboration or aid given by either country mentioned - including both China and Russia.

this for instance with my friend professor Jeang wei way he was in this uh China Russ audience as then he had he had to go to his own panel and he said of course there is but this is uh uh this is not in the open in cannot be in the open in China and it's not the Chinese way of doing the Chinese are extremely discreet especially when it comes to helping a partner that for them is a matter of national security as you know Very well Nema It's not only that deal which is not 10 years it's actually 20 years the $400 billion plus deal between Iran and China energy and infrastructure Uh so it's a matter of national security for China and whatever happens Iran will have China's back China will have Iran's back I'm sorry So so it was good to have even if we had let's say tur and tentative answers but basically you got answers to these questions you know and it was good that this came out in the plenary session especially apart from that ju just to close this introduction the atmosphere was was buzzing everywhere you could you you could feel that there were deals being struck all the time I gave an example in my telegram column I interviewed a high power Chinese CEO dressed Hong Kong style.

Name: Buzzing Everywhere You Could Feel That There Were Deals Being Struck All The Time
I gave an example in my Telegram column; I interviewed a high-power Chinese CEO dressed Hong Kong style. 
She said she's going to move, she's going to live in Hong Kong next year. Currently, she is in Beijing. Her company wants to invest in Donetsk, which is something that nobody in the West knows. Then my Donbas friends arranged an interview with the Number Two of Donetskâ€”a great guy who told me that every day, he receives inquiries from Chinese companies interested in coming here and seeing the investment possibilities. Min.

could become uh quite something a mix of a spe um uh special economic zone uh important port and a tourism hub as well So um if you don't go to a forum like this you are literally uh blinded by the western narrative And of course everybody I I talked to people people from Astrakan for instance which is part of the international north south transportation corp they love talking to foreign uh journalists and analysts because they are of course you know it's impossible for them to talk to the west and they are doing absolutely amazing stuff uh in ter in terms of integration they talk about how the federal government is investing a lot in all these oblasts and these uh public private uh partnerships So this is just to give you and our audience a small glimpse of how important this forum was Even all of us hostages of this absolutely horrendous situation in West Asia You have over 10, 000 people over there for three days non-stop networking and doing business So this is the future and it's not it's no wonder that one of the most important quotes from Putin during his plenary session is that he said we uh not only uh we Russia we are betting on bricks as the future but we are betting on.

Name: Speaker A
Putin during his plenary session said, "We [Russia] are betting on bricks as the future. " He also added that they were betting on a new growth model which implies a completely different approach than what has been practiced since 1945. Regarding the situation in the Middle East or West Asia, specifically discussions about Iran and Israel, the mainstream media in the West portrays an incorrect narrative by claiming that Iran was defeated and destroyed. This misinformation campaign perpetuates through various outlets such as those based in Brussels. The truth of the matter lies within understanding how these countries interact and forming opinions without relying solely upon bi.



"Name": Perpetua, ""Reporter""
"Interviewer": James, ""Journalist""
Perpetua: Well, I mean, certainly there's no shortage of sources perpetuating false information about these issues. However, it's important to recognize that many of these claims lack credibility and often serve as propaganda tools rather than actual journalistic reporting. In terms of understanding the complexities at play in conflicts like those mentioned, it requires nuanced analysis and firsthand knowledge - something that cannot be gained simply from watching Fox News or other similarly biased media outlets. Additionally, while there may be elements of 'fake news' coming out of certain regions, painting entire nations.

not only how the Iranian system works how do they make decisions what constitutes an existential threat to Iran how Iran h deals with his neighbors with the Arab world and with Eurasia at large and how Iran has been preparing for this war now for decades because they knew not because they are they are crystal ball readers but because they knew it would be inevitable It's a war of the turbo capitalist system against the Islamic revolution This is the key And now the people behind it they think that they have an opening For instance I have a lot of respect for Sai Hersh Uh when I was growing up when I was still in college Sai Hersh was one of my mo role models as an investigative uh journalist But Sai uh there's a problem with Sai because first of all he doesn't know West Asia very well which is an enormous problem if you are an investigative journalist Well he basically concentrates in in Washington and his gigantic role decks He can pick up the phone and talk to anybody he wants in Washington This is fantastic Nobody has that kind of of access Right But for instance he writes a piece that is absolutely terrifying this week on his Substack basically reproducing what his sources.

Washington This is fantastic Nobody has that kind of of access Right But for instance he writes a piece that is absolutely terrifying this week on his Substack basically reproducing what his sources which are deep uh industrial military complex deeper industrial military complex and Zionist silos working around Washington Virginia and Maryland And what what is it about It's about the war that they always wanted since at least 1998 If some of them they want this war since 1979 as you know very well Regime change in Iran Uh elimination of the Iranian civilian nuclear program Elimination of Islamic ballistic missiles basically destroying Iran like they did like they destroyed Iraq without thinking obviously for one minute about uh Iranian capabilities geography you name it of course not these people don't first of all they don't understand they never learn anything from geography history and both so when you read Sihar's piece it is terrifying the level of stupidity and ignorance of these people is terrifying but the problem is some some of these people interviewed by Hirs they have access to decision making in Washington and that's what makes it even more dangerous and it's a quite.



Name: Person A
Person B: Yeah
Name: Alex Christoforou.

Name: Person A 
Speech: 
Yeah.

Person A: Yeah, worse than losing everything. Nobody is afraid of the Israelis anymore. Everybody knows that they are a killing machine. But it's very, very convenient to be a killing machineâ€”killing women, children, hospitals, journalists, humanitarian help, etc. â€”from above with missiles. Try to match yourself against a real regional power. They are having their ass kicked little by little, the Iranian way. Because Iran, for the moment, hasn't entered a war against Israel. They are probing; it's a sort of a little by little escalation to achieve strategic deterrence, which, in some aspects, they already have. There.

to be attacked by Israel several raids a day missiles targeted assassinations you name it But the destruction that they already inflicted in Tel Aviv and beyond is now unimaginable for everyone Nobody could ever imagine that missiles will be destroying neighborhoods in Israel landing near Dona destroying most of the port of Hifa. The mayor of Hifa is desperate now, is begging for.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: Hmm. Name: Mayor of Hifa.

Name: Mayor of Hifa
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Name: Major General Gurbir S. Singh
Speaker 3: There's absolutely no one at the Pentagon to tell the President of the United States how completely absurd this whole idea is.

Major General Gurbir S. Singh: There's absolutely no one at the Pentagon to tell the President of the United States how completely absurd this whole idea is. The whole notion is so absurd that even Trump himself apparently isn't convinced. A five-year-old wouldn't be convinced either, but that's where we are. And it just keeps getting worse by the minute. 
Nemesis Calling: We all know it's not really up to Trump anyway. This decision was made by those pulling the strings behind the scenes - and they're driving him towards it too. In fact, he seems scared because he feels like he's being backed into a.

Name: Person 1
Message: It just keeps getting worse though, doesn't it? With his approval ratings tanking even among Republicans, not to mention everyone else. . . they must be terrified of him losing the next election either way. That's why they keep pushing these crazy conspiracy theories about mail-in ballots being rigged or stolen. They think if they can convince enough people that the results won't be valid no matter who wins then maybe they can avoid having to deal with an angry mob coming after them afterwards. But honestly, it's just pathetic at this point.

of course and once again they all come back to the same point We have a war here in our borders First we need to solve this and now they're fully concentrated uh what's going to happen in the next few months Uh the conditions are going to be much much tougher if uh not uh Kiev but Kiev's sponsors don't accept what's on the table put on the table by the Russians and meanwhile they keep organizing forums like this so the whole of the global south can get together and strike business deals So there there's always the other side of the coin IMA right The auspicious side of the the coin even in the middle of such darkness What was so important about the the point that Putin raised in St Petersburg said he said that Russia and Iran are fighting the same forces The same this was brilliant Wow Everybody knows what he means He doesn't need to get into detail and Putin doesn't he never needs to spell out okay he needs to spell out especially for Kab But when he's talking to a broad audience which in this case was a global audience everybody was waiting okay what is he going to say about Iran This is possibly the key quote because you can inter interpret this at several levels and at the.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: Vladimir Putin.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will continue its business dealings with Iran, including helping them in their civilian nuclear program. They are not backing down from any of this. This is clear, and the Americans, who can read, understand this too. Obviously, from the perspective of the Zionist axis, nothing changes because they are fanatics and believe they have the opportunity for regime change in Iran. In reality, however, there seems to be no progress towards achieving such a change in Iran. According to Sai piece - if only he had mentioned this explicitly instead of talking about decapitating or assassinating individuals within the government â€“ his aim appeared.

was around September September October So a few months before shock and all And I saw by myself how the country was impoverished after how many 20 years almost 20 years of sanctions destroyed Uh the only thing that more or less worked was the mukabarat the intel services and it would be very easy if the Americans launched and it was uh and even like that it took three three weeks for the whole thing to collapse and it only collapsed because they distributed a lot of money to Saddam's generals Iran now Iran is solid even of course there is oppos you know of course there is opposition uh to the government especially in north Iran the upper middle class the people who dream of Iran under the sha etc but it's a minority in Iran uh so and the fact that now the nation was attacked directly it unified the nation completely as you know very well Nema but try to explain this in Washington Nobody will understand First of all these idiots never been to Iran They don't know how it works They don't know anything The culture history how the system works You name it Uh different levels of popularity If you compare uh Kistan with Mashad with the Caspian with the Persian Gulf and they don't even.



"John": 'Know nothing about the culture, history, and systems of other countries. '
"Mark": Different levels of popularity exist between regions such as Kistan, Mashad, the Caspian Sea area, and the Persian Gulf region. People there seem obsessed with getting rid of an individual named Kam while not understanding various aspects of their own country. This shows a high degree of ignorance and foolishness.
"John": Exactly my point Mark. It seems like they want to replace their leader without considering his accomplishments or struggles faced during his reign which might affect stability afterward. Moreover, instead of focusing on internal reforms required for nation-building processes post-.

. . . etc. Jane Smith: This is very serious. Nobody in Washington seems to be listening to anyone else. There is a strong possibility of a disastrous mistake happening. They'll regret getting involved.



Name: Jane Smith
This is very serious. Nobody in Washington seems to be listening to anyone else. There is a strong possibility of a disastrous mistake happening. They'll regret getting involved. Absolutely we are totally prepared to fight it and come in and do it. We are prepared to respond to you. 
It's not just about Iran. Yemen just announced that they will attack the United States in the Red Sea if the US dares to attack Iran. On the other hand, I heard something from China through Victor G. , who said, "go is very good. " He added, "history will eventually have its own verdict" regarding whether or not other countries should join the fight on the.

Person 1: So you think we should buy this product from China?
Victor G. : Yes, go for it. History will eventually have its own verdict on whether others should join the fight against Iran's nuclear program.
Person 2: But isn't the sanctions imposed on them unfair? Aren't we starting an unnecessary war?
Victor G. : Exactly. The imposition of sanctions on Iran is unjustified, a war of aggression, and a surprise attack. Any country facing such circumstances has full legal justification to fight back.

talking about it Unlike what the United States and Europeans do Uh yes because they are masters of uh narrative twisting and blah blah blah And Russia Iran and China they have interlocked strategic partnerships It's on a completely different level There's no comparison Civilization states who have interlocking strategic partnerships and have the same interest and they are all on board on the main theme of the forum of St Petersburg until yesterday the construction of an integrated Eurasia and they are the three top actors We cannot say India is one of the top actors Definitely not By the way there are not many in there there was um yes there was a sizable Indian delegation in St St Petersburg but they didn't say anything remotely consequential And their position is for instance I'm sure you noticed that the Shangai Corporation organization blatantly uh condemned Israel in an official communicate Guess who was not part of the condemnation India So the other SEO members are already looking at India They say do they really belong here you see and it's completely stupid because they depend on Russia they depend on Iran They are partners in the international north south transportation.

Name:
The mainstream media keeps asking questions about Pakistan being an alleged safe haven for terrorists. What can you tell us?

Name: Mainstream Media
Mainstream Media: Keep asking questions about Pakistan being an alleged safe haven for terrorists. Can you tell us something?
Name: Pepe Escobar
Pepe Escobar: The mainstream media should ask why Washington has been unable to prove its claims despite having all the resources at their disposal. Also, they should question who benefits from such accusations against Pakistan. As for Iran, well, there is always some drama or another surrounding them - whether it's the missile issue or their nuclear program. But let me make something clear: Iran sees no solution other than fighting back against the United States.

between actually it wasn't the war it was the Israeli attack on Iran started on on June 13 on Friday They started this All right It started on a Friday Is that because my It was two days before Sunday that they were going to talk in Yeah In Oman if I'm not mistaken between the United States in Oman You're right Nema Exactly So but I lost track because No you go crazy in our case Yeah It's all I I totally understand that Since then they have received 14 weapon shipments from the United States and Germany to just sustain sustain certainly interceptors we are we we don't know what's inside of but okay if we want to bet interceptors because they are actually running from out of interceptor we can we can see that they are not only they are intercepting much less but they are very very careful with how many intercept chapters they're going to launch because they know that it's dwindling and it's part of the Iranian strategy once again And did the Iranians lose anything important so far On the contrary they got rid of all their older missiles And what were the older missiles doing Depleting the interceptor uh fleet Let's put it this way Brilliant Straight to the point Very simple.

"far", "on the contrary they got rid of all their older missiles". "And what were the older missiles doing? Depleting the interceptor  fleet. " "Let's put it this way. . . Brilliant! ".

Name: Speaker A
Speaker B: No no not really I mean yes but you know it's just like they don't want us to think about those things.

Name: Speaker A
Speaker B: No no not really I mean yes but you know it's just like. . . they don't want us to think about those things. We are on Level Four now. Absolutely. And they are desperate because there's nothing they can do at Level Three. They're going to start a nuclear war against Russia. They will lose. Do they have what it takes to attack Russia? No, they don't. In every aspect. Are they going to accept that they are being strategically defeated by Russia? No, they won't. Will that change anything? No, it won't. So okay, let's talk about regime change in Iran.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2:.

Name: Speaker 1
Speaker 2: is a glimmer of light over there so even if I am in shackles here I can maybe you know have one that  we may be at this point now a a angel of history correction of all the horrors unleashed by that construct in West Asia So that of course and this involves unimaginable suffering and horrors but you know always you have to pay history is not free for anybody You have to pay and even the winners or even the pe the the people's culture civilizations who resurrect they have to pay a horrible price for it  in the case of Russia they had to pay  the '9.

Name: anybody
Speaker: Okay so let's talk about. . . what can we take away from this? Any lessons learned here?
Name: Pepe
Response: The biggest lesson here is that no matter how powerful or influential someone may seem, they too can fall victim to arrogance and hubris. Trump thought he was untouchable due to his wealth and status but underestimated the power of truth and justice. This should serve as a reminder to everyone â€“ including world leaders â€“ that ultimately, the truth always prevails. Additionally, it highlights the importance of being informed and relying on accurate sources of information rather than basing decisions off personal biases or misguided belief.

Name: TruthSeeker
Name: Dave Rubin.

Name: TruthSeeker
Name: Could you please rephrase your question? There seems to be some confusion or missing context.



TruthSeeker: Could you clarify your statement about the fear of making decisions related to naval operations due to external factors? Additionally, could you elaborate on why vessels caught in the situation are unable to express their concerns or disagreements? Lastly, have there been any instances where countries like Iran have had similar experiences with other major powers influencing decision-making processes regarding military actions involving their own territories?

be devastating We're going to destroy Iranian nuclear facilities and all of that I we know these sort of rhetorics They're they they want to make the case for the administration to go after the plan to attack Iran They don't care about the outcome They don't care about what's going on in the aftermath of that attack But that would be the end of Donald Trump and his administration in my opinion because look at what's going on in the United States with MAGA Look at what's going on with Tucker Carlson It's not just about Taco Carson Matt Gates Somehow they tried to convince or somehow put pressure on Tulsi Gabbard She backed down in her recent tweet on X But after all you cannot change the base You cannot change the mindset of those people who voted for you who wanted some sort of change These are big things that are happening in the in my opinion in the mind of Donald Trump himself before going to Iran It's not just about Iran It's about the future of the United States Absolutely Um well once again he's caught in a net in a very elaborated trap set up by the Zionist axis and he's expendable Nema He's another expendable US president If his presidency implodes because of a out of.



Name: Shahidul Islam.

Name: Shahidul Islam 
Speaker 1: Well so we are all hostages of this . . .
Speaker 2: Death Cult?
Speaker 1: In the title of one of my columns yeah exactly. And the death cult isn't just Israel; it's impregnated in the tissues of the U. S. government. We all know Eisenhower warned everyone about it. We all know that JFK fought against it - and we all know what happened afterward.
No one can deny that. Even European nations like Britain and Germany are helping Israel. Britain is reportedly preparing its own fighter jets for deployment in the region alongside America.

Name: Person 1
Afterward, no one can deny that. Even European nations like Britain and Germany are helping Israel. Britain is reportedly preparing its own fighter jets for deployment in the region alongside America.

The consequences are clear; nobody can doubt the military capabilities of these countries. They cannot fight a conventional war against Iran without serious consequences. Pepe: Yes, I agree completely. If the United States finally decides to attack Iran, I would say they're not going to be able to achieve regime change, let alone win the war. The outcome would be devastating for both sides involved and could potentially destabilize the entire region. Ismael: That's right! Attacking Iran.

Name: Ismael
Name: Nema
Nema: Absolutely correct. Any military action against Iran by the United States or its allies is highly unlikely to result in regime change, let alone win the war. The outcome would be devastating for both sides involved and could potentially destabilize the entire region.

ordinary people talking about because they they want to hear the argument on the part of the west They know what they're doing and they were preparing for this They knew that this would come to them This reminds me uh Nema one of the things that struck me last It's incredible I was in Iran last months when I went to Sistan Baluchistan Finally the people that I talk Sistan is more to the N more to the north sorry of of the huge province as you know and the Baluchi we were interacting with Baluches all the time They saw they see themselves first and foremost as Iranians No they're not separatists at all Even though the province is enormous has a very peculiar history is very far away from the center No but they see themselves as Iranians and the development of Chabahar port it's for the good of Iran So it is this feeling of national unity you see it every in the Caspian I saw that in the Caspian as well Same thing So what you're saying is absolutely correct It's it's all over You cannot analyze Iran based on the differences between North Iran wealthy and South Iran proletarian No it's much more complex than that Exactly Let's see what would happen But I don't see anything What's.



Mima: analyse Iran based on the differences between North Iran wealthy and South Iran proletarian? No it's much more complex than that. . . Exactly. Let's see what would happen. . . 
But I don't see anything.



Name: Alyssa
Speaker: But I don't see anything. . . inside the society and nobody knows they're gonna fight these these people would fight the United States to the last one to they they going to fight back and I I hope there is somebody in the United States hearing what's going on you know and seeing the reality of what's going on not through the propaganda these people who were who who were simply receiving money to manipulate the the analysis on their part from Iran These mostly Iranians who are living outside of Iran trying to give false pictures to the administration in the United States in Europe because they're receiving they're somehow they're puppets of many are being paid actually Yeah This.

Mansoor Salari: We have been seeing inside of Iran that some of them are trying to create chaos and problems outside of Iran trying to give false pictures to the administration in the United States in Europe because they're receiving they're somehow they're puppets of many are being paid actually Yeah This Asia They're going to learn it if they go with the attack on Iran They're going to learn it They're going to find something that has never happened before to the United States It's something big It's something big there there must be there shall be prepared they shall prepare for that in my opinion it's yeah the only thing that I can say and but I don't see the.
